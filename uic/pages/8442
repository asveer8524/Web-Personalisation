<p class="p1">The UIC Neighborhoods Initiative (UICNI) is a flagship program of the Great Cities Institute.</p>
<p class="p1">GCI was a pioneer in the national movement to harness the resources of universities in service to communities. UICNI gained early funding from the <i>U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Community Outreach Partnership Centers (COPC) grant program</i>. The COPC grant, no longer available, supported colleges and universities to apply their human, intellectual and institutional resources to the challenge of revitalizing distressed communities.</p>
<p class="p1">Through the UICNI initiative, GCI and UIC are able to carry out their collective mission of serving the local community through engaged scholarship, research and service at the local community and metropolitan region level.</p>
<h2>Organizational Model: <i>Multi-Disciplinary, Campus-Wide Partnership</i></h2>
<p class="p1">Since its inception, UICNI has approached its work with communities as an opportunity to build partnerships that are mutually beneficial for the university community (faculty, scholars, and students) as well as the external community.</p>
<p class="p1">As a result, UICNI was formed based on a unique organizational model that combines resources from numerous units and colleges and coordinates multi-disciplinary, campus-wide partnerships between community organizations and UIC students and faculty.</p>
<p class="p1">The UICNI initiative typically includes technical assistance and training to community-based organizations, institutions, and local government agencies in:</p>

<li><b>Formal evaluations of ongoing community programs</b></li>
<li><b>Participatory planning</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A current priority of The Great Cities Institute Neighborhood Initiative is programming focused on <a title="Participatory Budgeting" href="https://greatcities.uic.edu/practice/uic-neighborhoods-initiative/participatory-budgeting/"><strong>Participatory Budgeting</strong></a> in Chicago.</p>
<h2>Participatory Planning</h2>
<p>As a part of GCI&#8217;s commitment to an engaged university, and its mission to improve quality of life in Chicago, and its metropolitan region, UICNI facilitates participatory community planning processes to give a voice to and advocate for residents&#8217; needs and wishes for their communities. UICNI provides technical assistance for community engagement, development of community plans, and continued support for implementation.</p>
<p>We believe in and are committed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recognizing and building upon the history and culture of neighborhoods.</li>
<li>Sustaining neighborhoods through social and economic vitality.</li>
<li>Advocating for planning processes and development policies that ensure economic equality, political self-representation, cultural preservation, and ecological conservation.</li>
<li>Ensuring planning processes foster active community participation for just and effective decision making.</li>
<li>Engaging in planning as multi-disciplinary, intergenerational, responsive to community needs, and developed through on-going, long-term relationships.</li>
<li>Forming mutually beneficial relationships based on respect and trust that results in positive contributions.</li>

<h2>Brief History of UIC Neighborhoods Initiative (UICNI)</h2>
<p class="p1">The UIC Neighborhoods Initiative (UICNI) promotes and facilitates partnerships between UIC faculty, staff and students, and elected officials, residents, and organizations in neighborhoods throughout the city. Historically, UICNI has pursued grant funding to implement community and economic development programs, primarily in the Pilsen, East and West Garfield Park, Near West Side, North and South Lawndale, West Town, and Humboldt Park neighborhoods. Once funding was secured, UICNI brokered partnerships, administered funds, collaboratively developed and implemented programs, and performed evaluations. Programs have focused on securing more affordable housing, youth development, civic engagement, capacity building, leadership development, improved educational resources, increasing employment, and redevelopment of commercial areas.</p>
<p class="p1">Over the past twenty years, UICNI has secured more than $6.5 million dollars, and implemented more than thirty community and economic development programs. UICNI has recruited over 100 students and 65 faculty members to work with over 100 neighborhood groups on community projects. Most importantly, hundreds of thousands of community members have benefited from the programs in their neighborhoods. UICNI has maintained its focus on collaboration with neighborhood groups, elected officials, institutions and residents through its’ current projects including annual implementation of participatory budgeting and community planning projects in multiple communities throughout the city.</p>
<h3>Past Programs</h3>
<p><strong>2011-2012 Civic Leaders Program</strong></p>
<p>The Civic Leadership Program was designed to identify Chicago’s next generation of civic leaders from among the city’s many neighborhood organizations, and to equip them with critical thinking and analysis skills to better engage with current topics, make informed choices and speak persuasively on policy issues. Seventeen community leaders, having been nominated by an Advisory Committee of UICNI staff and affiliates with strong community connections, came from organizations in distressed neighborhoods. They attended workshops led by UIC faculty, covering critical topics such as foreclosure and sub-prime lending, youth violence, tax increment financing, and balancing Chicago’s budget. After each topic workshop, participants had to adopt and defend a position on the policy issue, writing and delivering a speech as though to various groups of potential constituents. The assignments were designed to analyze current literature and research about a policy issue, as well as to practice articulating a strong stance within the context of political rhetoric.</p>
<p>The program identified five programmatic outcomes including increased fluency on issues of urban policy; increased ability to craft a political strategy for different target audiences; developing connections to other emerging leaders encountered in the program; psychological support for the idea of running for office as a result of demystifying the process; developing connections to UIC as a resource for developing positions on issues of urban policy; and increased knowledge of the role of the university in building civic capacity and engagement. In post-program evaluations, 100% of respondents indicated that as a result of participating in the program they had increased knowledge and understanding of urban policy issues and increased ability to craft a political strategy and message for different target audiences. Overall, participant responses indicated that the program successfully developed their leadership skills and knowledge.</p>
<p>Funding Source: Institute for Policy and Civic Engagement</p>
<p><strong>2011-2012 Certificate in Sustainable Fund Development</strong></p>
<p>Designed to strengthen the sustainability of community-based nonprofit organizations, the Certificate in Sustainable Fund Development program was a customized training program for non-profits in three west side tax increment financing (TIF) districts (Homan-Arthington, Humboldt Park, and Central West TIFs). The program provided twelve training sessions on fund development strategies and nonprofit management activities such as board governance, grant writing, and program evaluation. Ten core participants (La Casa Norte, West Town Bikes, Latin United Community Housing Association, Young People’s Project, the Block Club Federation, Latino Cultural Exchange Coalition, Near West Side Community Development Corporation, Girls in the Game, Homan Square Community Center, and Family Focus Lawndale) received individualized technical assistance at their offices. These sessions covered a comprehensive assessment of the organization’s overall capacity, followed by an evaluation of capacity building needs and a customized capacity building plan. Over the course of the program, 42 hours of group training was provided to 48 participants from 22 organizations and 247 hours of individualized technical assistance was provided to the core group of organizations. Exit interviews and surveys both indicated that participants felt the program was beneficial, that their advisors were excellent, and that they gained useful knowledge and skills that built the capacity building of their organizations.</p>
<p>Funding Source: City of Chicago TIF Works</p>
<p><strong>2009-2011 ChiWest Resource Net</strong></p>
<p>The goal of the ChiWest ResourceNet project was to build the capacity of community-based (CBOs) and faith-based organizations (FBOs) in seven severely distressed low-income Chicago community areas (East and West Garfield Park, North and South Lawndale, Humboldt Park, Near West Side, and Pilsen). With an average poverty rate of 32% in these communities, the need for resources among organizations providing social services in these areas is acute; in this project, the focus was assisting organizations with annual operating budgets under $500,000. Capacity building activities focused on enhancing leadership development, organizational development, program development and community engagement, using strategies such as outreach, designing and conducting a sub-award program, conducting one-on-one technical assistance, and delivering capacity building trainings and workshops. Thirty-six organizations took part in the programs, while 19 received financial subawards totaling $240,000. Among these, 24 participated in leadership development activities such as executive coaching and recruiting board members; 27 engaged in management improvement activities such as creating a Strategic Plan and/or a Revenue Development Plan; 23 took steps to improve the reach of their services, or their efficiency in delivering them; and 11 organizations reported an increase in the number of people served as a result, citing the capacity-building activities in which they participated as part of ChiWest as the reason for this result.</p>

<p><strong>2008-2011 Illinois ResourceNet: A Funding Access Initiative</strong></p>
<p>Illinois ResourceNet: A Funding Access Initiative (IRN) was a university-based program providing Illinois nonprofits and local governments with the skills and knowledge to access federal funding. UICNI partnered with the University of Illinois Extension system to offer training and technical assistance around the state of Illinois. IRN offered organizations a unique approach to grant access, centered on providing information and resources on an interactive website, working with experienced technical assistants to develop quality proposals, and connecting with a diverse group of partners to meet proposed project goals. Technical Assistance took the form of direct, one-on-one assistance on active federal proposals that were then submitted for funding, and more general assistance through learning opportunities such as workshops, online courses, discussions, conferences, and networking. IRN provided new resource development tools to 135,000 or more individuals and organizations and offered more than 95 separate presentations, conferences, and trainings. Nonprofit organizations and municipalities that received technical assistance from IRN submitted a total of 127 proposals for federal and state funding that resulted in a total of $113,188,419 in federal funding and $29,224,391 in state funding.</p>
<p>Funding Source: Grand Victoria Foundation</p>
<p><strong>2004-2007 New Directions </strong></p>
<p>In partnership with the Vorhees Center, New Directions addressed two urgent needs facing residents from the North Lawndale community: the need for leaner, stronger, more savvy community organizations to serve the many low-income residents; and need for affordable and accessible housing in North Lawndale. Many community partners were engaged in the program, including North Lawndale Community News, North Lawndale Employment Network, Steans Family Foundation, Access Living, and the Chicago Rehab Network. The grant also engaged seven UIC faculty, staff, and over 300 students through studio courses and research assistant seminars.</p>

<p><strong>2004-2005 Intimate Portraits Project</strong></p>
<p>This project, a literacy initiative executed in partnership with Miles Square Health Center, was based on the work of Professor Hal Adams as part of the UIC College of Education’s Community Writing Project, where writing workshops were held for “people who do not ordinarily consider themselves to be writers, and publishe[d] their reflections on everyday life in the magazine Real Conditions.” The project provided literary space for community residents to express their thoughts, feelings, and experiences in writing. During workshop sessions, conversations and reflections revolved around issues parents were facing in the community, personal experiences, and other topics as raised by the authors. Participants were assisted by workshops on learning writing strategies including how to begin writing letters, personal journaling, and literary devices to help the authors discover the various ways one can express one’s thoughts.</p>

<p>Working with community organizations including The Resurrection Project, Eighteenth Street Development Corporation, and the Chicago Rehab Network, the purpose of the consortium was to create an affordable housing coalition to help existing neighborhood community development corporations (CDCs) expand their capacity. Faculty and graduate students from the College of Urban Planning and Policy and the School of Architecture worked with CDCs in the Pilsen and Near West Side neighborhoods to share resources and expertise that would contribute to improving housing conditions and enhancing housing development efforts. The program also sought to document and share knowledge and experience gained in Pilsen and the Near West Side, as both areas are typical of many of Chicago’s older inner-city neighborhoods in need of housing improvements.</p>

<p><strong>1994-2001 Neighborhoods Non-Profit Network</strong></p>
<p>In this program supported by UIC’s College of Engineering, over 100 staff from fifty community organizations were connected to a network on UIC&#8217;s computer system. Through the network, participants could access email, Non-Profit Network NNNet Web pages, home pages, and UICOMPAR discussion forum for connected organizations.</p>

<p><strong>1994-1999 Parent Leadership Programs</strong></p>
<p>Based on feedback provided by public school principals, who felt that many parents would like to become more involved in school and community issues, but held back because they were self-conscious of their communication skills and knowledge of community issues, this program was established with a focus on adult literacy and community health. Parents and adult friends of children who attended a public elementary school met twice weekly for a writing workshop to write and discuss their experiences living in the community. More than 70 adults were involved in the program, and their writings were used to begin production of a magazine, &#8220;The Journal of Ordinary Thought.&#8221; A faculty member from UIC&#8217;s College of Education worked directly with program participants to the produce numerous editions of the magazine. In Pilsen, the College of Education worked with the Instituto del Progresso Latino to produce a journal titled &#8220;Community Voices,” which also featured the writings of program participants. The program also sought to increase parents&#8217; understanding of community issues and to develop their abilities to address them.</p>

<p><strong>1994-1996 Commercial and Industrial Area Design Workshops</strong></p>
<p>UICNI partnered with the Schools of Architecture and Art and Design, The Resurrection Project and the Eighteenth Street Development Corporation to conduct workshops that were geared towards improving the physical attractiveness of commercial and industrial areas in Pilsen and the Near West Side. Students worked with the communities to develop plans for redesigning depressed commercial areas and mass transit stations, enhancing public open spaces. The program also worked with local businesses to ensure that existing industries and employment bases were maintained.</p>

<p><strong>1994-1996 Hiring and Purchasing Community Linkage Program</strong></p>
<p>This was an effort to more closely link UIC with residents and businesses in neighboring Pilsen and the Near West Side. UICNI partnered with the UIC Center for Urban Economic Development and the UIC Department of Economics to initiate a study to determine how UIC job opportunities and contracts could be better linked to workers and businesses in areas adjacent to the University. As a result of the study, mechanisms were established to channel information about job openings to community-based job developers, such as the Renacer Westside Community Network and the Eighteenth Street Development Corporation, who may refer qualified residents to apply for open positions. Additionally, information on UIC&#8217;s procurement process was also distributed to area businesses and community development corporations, to enhance their awareness of potential opportunities to do business with the University.</p>

<p><strong>1994-1996 Incubators for Youth</strong></p>
<p>Incubators for Youth offered young males living in public housing the opportunity to explore entrepreneurial activities. UICNI partnered with the UIC Center for Urban Business who, in collaboration with the Chicago Housing Authority&#8217;s Economic Development Department, designed and implemented the Incubators for Youth program. The program objectives were to develop alternative activities for teenage males ages 13 to 19; to identify viable business activities that can be developed into youth enterprises; to develop essential skills in marketing, management, record keeping and finance; to develop life skills that are vital to successful adult development; and to develop non-violent problem solving skills that are applicable in business as well as everyday life. The program also sought to make use of CHA resources that had been under- or un-utilized.</p>
<p>Funding Source: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (COPC)</p>
<p><strong>1994-1996 Great Cities, Great Careers</strong></p>
<p>This initiative was a partnership between UICNI, Benito Juarez High School in Pilsen and Richard T. Crane High School on the Near West Side, and UIC’s Colleges of Education and Urban Planning and Public Affairs. It sought to prepare students from these public high schools for entry-level jobs upon graduation by emphasizing marketable skill development and training. To achieve the program goal of creating 30 to 50 jobs annually for the high school graduates, along with graduates from Malcolm X College, UIC secured a commitment from Montgomery Ward &amp; Company not only to create entry-level jobs, but also to secure the participation of other corporations as well.</p>
