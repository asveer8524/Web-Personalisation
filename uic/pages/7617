<p>Back in high school, there were different cliques from the jocks to the nerds and from the loners to those who often did “recreational fun.” I fell somewhere in between, not really fitting in any single group, but befriending enough people from each group that I was still known. I was seen as the nice girl, the smart girl, the innocent girl, but all of these titles never truly defined me; these were just the generalizations given to anybody without any standout characteristics. In a way, they were right; I was the type of student who always strove to get As, who always abided by the rules, who didn’t go out to party because of studies, and who was quiet enough not to be memorable. In high school, I didn’t see the need to fit in and have a clique to call my own; I had a few special friends who I could truly express myself with, and I had my alone time to cherish. These things were enough for me back then, but after entering college, I realized that I wanted to experience more things, to live a life outside of academics and the clubs that I merely joined to look good on a college application. I wanted to free myself enough to finally start enjoying life instead of waiting to enjoy life in the future.</p>
<p>By some crazy, unplanned move, I summoned up the courage to ask a stranger out. This was uncharacteristic of the girl no one really paid attention to, who has always been labeled as the nice, shy one. Well, overall, the date probably went okay to outsiders, but to the girl who always over-analyzes a situation, the date went horribly.</p>
<p>Let’s call this guy Jeffrey. Jeffrey was three years older than me, and the stories he talked feverishly about demonstrated how much more experienced he was than me. He had so many interests to talk about from his passion about becoming a cop one day to his obsession with sports and dancing, and finally, to his dreams of one day backpacking alone in a foreign country. I loved hearing him talk about his stories; they were passionate and well-phrased, demonstrating his comfort in socializing.</p>
<p>But then came the question that I feared the most: “So what do you do for fun?” My brain stopped working, and I honestly didn’t know what to say. I stammered out a few things that I wasn’t actually passionate about, and finally, I just said the first thing that came to mind, “I don’t really have the time to do much but study.” At that moment, I perpetuated the Asian stereotype, and I felt so ashamed (I mean this guy was Asian too, but at least he was the interesting type who did more than study). At that moment, the date went downhill, and there was some uncomfortable stammering and a few awkward silences. I just wanted to crawl into a hole but instead, I kept reverting the questions back at him to ignore the fact that I was not as interesting as him. Let’s just say, at the end of the date, when he drove me home, I messaged him, and I have yet to receive a reply back.</p>
<p>So, you ask, “What’s the point of this cringey, overdrawn story?” Well, besides wanting to reflect on a horrible date that I just came back from, I wanted to share my experience with those of you who have never gone on a date or who have also had a “cringey” first date experience.</p>
<p>Despite me saying that it was an awful first date, I honestly don’t regret it at all. It got me out of my comfort zone and forced me to see that asking someone out, especially a guy, isn’t as terrifying as it seems. Sure, they might say no, and sure, the date may not go as smoothly as you hoped for, but there will be more dates to go on with a newfound courage that is released when you finally make that move. So maybe, on the second, third, fourth, or even fifth date I go on, I’ll finally have the right words to say that paint me in a light that truly reflects who I am.</p>

		<p><img class=" wp-image-1409 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/charlottesville-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="530" height="353" srcset="https://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/charlottesville-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/charlottesville-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/charlottesville-330x220.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was not prepared, emotionally, for the events at Charlottesville. I did not expect the effects that it would have on me, as a self-proclaimed Afro-centric person. I expected that, should I ever see white men march through the streets shouting racist rhetoric, I would immediately be filled with rage, ready to strike back against them. To push them back into whichever dark and musty little corners of life that they came from. Instead, all I could do was walk away from the television, lie down in my bed and cry. No matter how I tried, I couldn’t grasp how one could feel </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> much hatred towards one person, let alone entire groups of people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason, I thought that I had fortified myself against feeling that kind of pain as a result of prejudice and discrimination. It’s not as if my family and I haven’t been called the N- word before by people with racist intent (excluding the cases of people ignorantly using the word in a disappointing mimicry of Black culture). It’s not as if I have not witnessed my younger cousins being watched and followed around stores. It’s not as if my family and I have not been kicked out of places of business, not because we were loud or causing an inconvenience, but simply because of the color of our skin. So why was I so upset? Shouldn’t I be used to this by now? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought that I had fortified myself because during high school, I made it my mission to learn about my people’s history, including the atrocities committed against the stolen humans of this country. It’s not like I had not seen the footage of people marching and singing “We Shall Overcome”, while trying to avoid shots of water that must have felt more like fire and the bites of barely-constrained canines. It’s not like I had not read about the horrors that occurred on the plantation. It’s not as if I had not seen the images of men recently lynched and/or burned by mobs dressed all in white. So why was I so upset, when I had already seen so many of the grotesque images that colored the history of African Americans in this country? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What bothered me the most, as I lay in my bed, was not the fact that these wastes of supposedly human flesh had actually marched through the streets with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tiki torches (</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">of all things</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s that</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t unsee the look on my father&#8217;s face (yes, father). He had been around to see the Civil Rights Movement. He had been just a year older than Emmett Till, when Till had been murdered. He had grown up hearing stories about slavery from his grandfather. He had grown up hearing about the time his grandfather had almost been lynched because his grandmother just so happened to be white passing. Recently, we were talking about what was happening in this world today, and all he could say was, “Nothing makes sense anymore.” And he’s right, nothing makes sense at all. So what’s my point? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My point is, we need to do better. Period. We need to take a look at what we casually say and do around one another and around the ears of younger individuals. We need to take a look at what people write off as “just joking,” because jokes often have some truth to them. We need to take a look at the idea of political correctness, not as an irritating reinforcement of modern social norms, but perhaps as a way of bettering ourselves as a society. As a way to move forward toward a better future, rather than remaining stagnant and/or possibly regressing back to the uglier times in this nation’s history. </span></p>

<p>One of the main reasons I chose to attend UIC was that UIC is a very research-intensive university. Research was something that I have always wanted to do since I was in high school, so attending UIC was the perfect choice. As an undergraduate, I believe that there are many benefits of conducting research. Undergraduate research allows students to develop their critical thinking skills such as problem-solving and observation, enhance their creativity, and build professional connections with other students and faculty. In addition, undergraduate research looks awesome on a resume when looking for jobs after graduation.</p>
<p>After searching for almost a year, I finally found a research position that I am genuinely interested in. While looking through the abstracts from the 2016 Student Research Forum, one particular student’s research really caught my eye, so I decided to send a quick email to the principal investigator. After about a week, I got a response that the team did indeed need help over the summer, so after I lot of contemplation I decided to join. I will be conducting research in the College of Nursing that aims to understand the relationship between hepcidin and iron metabolism and the maternal and birth outcomes associated with hepcidin. Hepcidin is a newly identified key regulator in iron homeostasis. It blocks gastrointestinal absorption of iron, immensely lowering the amount of iron available to both fetus and mother during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Initially, I will only be undergoing training over the summer to recruit and screen patients who may be eligible for the study. After the training period, I will be taking additional responsibilities such as maternal and fetal blood processing in addition to screening and recruiting. I am most interested in learning about impacts on fetal neurocognitive development due to low levels of maternal iron. My goal is to conduct an independent capstone project based on the research study by my senior year and present it at a research forum.</p>
<p>Even though I am a little nervous to start the research position, I am so thankful to have been given the opportunity by UIC and am also really excited to gain outside of classroom experience. Since I will be getting plenty of interactions with patients, I will be more prepared to pursue my career goal of becoming a gynecological oncologist in the future.</p>

<p>Former United States First Lady Michelle Obama said, “No country can ever truly flourish if it stifles the potential of its women and deprives itself of the contributions of half of its citizens” (People Magazine). Despite the tremendous progress of women’s rights over the past century, women in many parts of the world are still unable to have productive and healthy lifestyles due to gender inequality and negative stereotypes. While living in both Pakistan and the United States, I became aware of the inferiority that many girls and young women feel with gender inequality and negative stereotypes. In Pakistan, I learned that many young girls living in poverty are often forced to get married early instead of fulfilling their educational and professional dreams. Over here, many of my friends are afraid to pursue male-dominated career fields such as computer science and engineering due to the backlash they may receive from others.</p>
<p>One of the many issues women are currently facing is a large gender pay gap During 2015, “Women working full time in the United States typically were paid just 80 percent of what men were paid, a gap of 20 percent” (AAUW). I believe that women should earn an equal salary compared to their male colleagues, especially since women often have to take upon other important responsibilities while working full-time. For instance, many full-time working mothers must nurture and care for their young children.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as I mentioned before, education is just one of the basic human rights that many young girls living in developing nations don’t have access to. Human rights activist Malala Yousafazai said, “Education is the best weapon we have to fight poverty, ignorance, and terrorism” (The Guardian). Education allows women to be provided with the resources needed to obtain jobs, and jobs can furthermore help them to earn a living for healthy and productive lifestyles.</p>
<p>Along with gender inequality, negative stereotypes pertaining to women can be very detrimental. Women who are sexual assault victims are often blamed for the incidents. It is believed that the victims physically reveal themselves too much and that triggers men to sexually assault them. However, this is not true. It is possible for a female to be fully covered and still experience sexual assault. This stereotype can also cause deleterious mental health problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and dissociation in sexual assault victims, preventing them from living life to the fullest (Joyful Heart Foundation).  Awareness about stereotypes about women is needed since these stereotypes can limit a woman’s ability to pursue professional careers and make decisions about her own life. Women’s rights and increased awareness about negative gender stereotypes are needed nationally so that the world can flourish and become more advanced.</p>

<p>I joined the Honors College at UIC primarily for personal and academic growth, and one of the ways I have grown is through the Honors College activities. Honors College students are required to participate in an honors activity each semester for at least three hours per week. There are numerous types of honors activities that students may participate in depending on their interests. My honors activities in the past have included taking an Honors Core course and participating in a service activity. Both of these honors activities have helped me build skills that are crucial for my post-graduation life.</p>
<p>In the spring 2016 semester, I enrolled in the Honors Core course HON123: Mental Health, Stigma, and Justice in Asian American communities. This course satisfied my general education requirements for Understanding the Individual and Society, and Understanding US. Society as well. In this course, I explored and analyzed the calamitous impacts that Asian Americans face due to the stigma of mental illness. I also learned about various barriers, other than stigma, that prevent Asian Americans from seeking mental health treatment. Additionally, we strategized potential methods that we could use to raise awareness about mental health stigma in Asian American Communities. One of the main reasons I took this course was because I felt like I could personally relate to the material, since my grandparents had recently immigrated from Pakistan  to the United States, and I was fearful of all the possible problems they may face in a completely new country. In addition to the content, though, at the end of the semester, I realized that I had also learned key critical thinking skills, such as evaluation and interpretation.</p>
<p>In the fall 2016 semester, I decided to do a service activity for my honors activity. Since I am a part of the UIC chapter for the New Life Volunteering Society, I used after-school tutoring as my honors activity. I tutored CPS students in middle school math, since math has been one of my strongest subjects. I personally recommend tutoring as an honors activity because of the numerous ways in which it has benefitted me. Since many of the CPS students often came from underprivileged and low-income families, I was inspired to learn that because of my help, they were able to improve their grades. Furthermore, while trying to explain math problems to the students, I challenged myself to come up with new creative approaches that could help them understand the material.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Honors College students may choose to do whatever honors activity they want. However, while choosing, I advise students to take into consideration how each particular honors activity may benefit them. I chose to take an Honors Core course and to tutor, because these honors activities have helped me to grow both emotionally and academically.</p>

<p>Stigma is “a mark of disgrace associated with a particular circumstance, quality, or person” (Oxford Dictionary). Stigma is something that can be inflicted on anyone and for any condition. For example, there are social stigmas associated with bankruptcy, homosexuality, and obesity. The list is never-ending. There is one particular stigma, however, that many people may be unaware of: the stigma toward people suffering from mental illness.</p>
<p>In addition to the distressing effects of the mental disorders themselves, sufferers of these disorders also have to face social stigma from society. These social stigmas include ideas that people with mental illness may be considered unintelligent, violent, dangerous, incapable of functioning in daily activities or attaining careers, and incapable of forming relationships. Many of these stigmas result from the inaccurate portrayal of mental illness in the media. News stories often feature headlines that mention mentally ill people committing crimes, and television and movies depict mentally ill people as being unstable and causing harm to other people.</p>
<p>This stigma needs to stop spreading, as it is one of the greatest barriers for people suffering from mental illness to live normal lives. Because of stigma, people with mental illness are often denied housing, health insurance, and jobs. They also can lose self-esteem and have trouble making friends, sometimes even becoming socially isolated. Additionally, they might not even seek help or treatment due to the fear of what others might think about them.</p>
<p>There are many ways in which we, as college students, can stop the stigma associated with mental illness. We can raise awareness about it by educating our family and friends. We shouldn’t give labels to the mentally ill, and instead we should use respectful, inclusive language. We shouldn’t be afraid of those dealing with mental illness just because they may exhibit unusual behavior. We shouldn’t be insensitive or blame them for their mental illness. Lastly, we should be role models. If our generation treats people with mental illness with respect and politeness, people will follow us and soon the stigma will be reduced to a great extent.</p>

<p>An integral component of the Honors College experience is the opportunity to take the Honors Core Courses. Honors Core Courses provide opportunities for students to explore a wide breadth of subjects in-depth, with topics ranging from love songs to the history of mathematics. Choosing an Honors Core Course can be challenging for some students, especially when viewing the pages and pages of choices. As a first-year student, I had to go through this process myself for the first time last fall, and I remember feeling both excited and overwhelmed by all the amazing options I saw before me. It seemed like I couldn’t possibly choose. Before long, however, I stumbled across the very last option in the course packet – HON 142, “Sentiment in Fiction: What Moves Us and How” &#8211; and I knew my search was over.</p>
<p>At first, I was hesitant – I knew I loved to read, but could I <em>afford</em> to enroll in a course for fun during my first semester? As a biological sciences major, I thought that I should devote my time to something more closely intertwined with my major instead, such as yet another science class. I walked into my “Sentiment in Fiction” class apprehensively, wondering all the while if I made the right choice.</p>
<p>By the third week, it was clear that I had. HON 142, taught by Dr. Christian Messenger, was a class driven by the analysis of sentiment and laced with philosophical undertones. It’s difficult to condense the vast array of topics we covered, but the central focus of the class was the governing power of fiction – specifically, what happens to our emotions when we read. All of the content intrigued me greatly, and by midterms, I was so invested that I found myself visiting Dr. Messenger’s office hours more and more often to discuss new perspectives on a book we’d been reading during a certain unit.</p>
<p>Other than the fact that the course gave a new meaning to reading which I previously didn’t know existed, HON 142 also showed me important philosophies behind choosing and staying with a class, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s 100% okay to take a class for fun. There’s a lot of pressure on college students to choose courses which will be <em>relevant </em>to both their major and chosen career path. I admit I once thought this, but I can safely say that if I still followed this ideology, I would have missed out on countless valuable and eye-opening experiences.</li>
<li>I learned that while it’s totally valid to want to develop and refine skills related to your major, don’t let that restrict you from branching out and taking classes for <em>you</em>. You’ll learn so much, and the memories will stay with you for months and months.</li>
<li>Don’t be blinded by the compulsive need to earn an A. If you’re truly interested, then your passion will drive you, and the rest will fall into place.</li>
<li>Last but not least, keep your mind open. At first, I thought an English course would be rooted purely in the humanities and have no intersection whatsoever in science, but the course ended up training me to be a critical thinker and an investigative reader, traits which extend beyond the humanities and carry into countless other studies.</li>
</ol>
<p>By the end of the course, I’d forgotten all about my initial fears of being too out of my element and of betraying the biology spirits by enjoying an English course. I couldn’t be more satisfied, and I encourage anyone who’s considering taking a class on the opposite side of the spectrum from their major to <em>do it</em>! College is about becoming proficient in your concentration, but it is also about exploration. Finding a perfect balance can lead to success and inward satisfaction.</p>

<p>Whether you are a commuter or you live in a dorm, we are all sometimes faced with having to find somewhere to sit to study between classes, or review material before a quiz or exam. I have compiled a list of 10 spots with simple descriptions, so you can make one of them your go-to study spot!</p>
<ol>
<li>Private room in Douglas hall</li>
</ol>
<p>Located on the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> floors, these study rooms are my favorite for when I need to be alone and completely focused, but I know some people use them for serious group work. Some rooms come with a whiteboard, and all of them have a big table with multiple chairs. In addition, you are guaranteed an outlet! Pro tip: Come to these EARLY in the morning, because they fill up very fast.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Honors College Lounge/Quiet Study Room</li>
</ol>
<p>The Honors College has two great rooms with plenty of chairs, tables, and outlets to use. The lounge can be used for group work, and has a microwave to heat up some lunch. The silent room is sometimes reserved by organizations, but I love to go there when it’s empty to zone in on my work.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Port Center Café</li>
</ol>
<p>Hidden on the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor of University Hall, you have to walk past the delicious coffee and sweets, and up the stairs to get to these study areas. There are couches to sit on and go over some notes with a friend and also tables and booths where you can enjoy a cup of coffee and mull over your work.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Idea Commons</li>
</ol>
<p>Located on the first floor of the library, this is THE place to go with a group to study. It is one of UIC’s most modern spaces, and the bright colors and spacious environment is very pleasing. There are huge whiteboards available for all to use, two computer labs, desks, and even lounge couches.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>BSB C-Stop</li>
</ol>
<p>This computer lab in BSB also has seating for group work, but when I go it is usually always quiet. I used it a lot when I studied for my psychology classes, because the lab is only a two-minute walk away. It also comes with printers and on-site help from consultants. It also has a reserveable room with a whiteboard and conference-style tables and chairs.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Commuter Lounge</li>
</ol>
<p>The Commuter Center has lots of seating areas for group and individual work, computers, and even a kitchen that has coffee, tea, and hot water, along with microwaves to heat up your lunch. If you come on the right day, sometimes they have free ice cream or other treats!</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>SCE Atrium</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a fun place to go and grab a table to look over some notes or type a paper. Sometimes, talented UIC students frequent this area to practice their dance routines.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Third Floor of the Daley Library</li>
</ol>
<p>The silent floor of the library isn’t everyone’s favorite place to be, but I find that it forces you to get your work done. Everyone there respects the no-talking rule, so it is perfect for intense study periods. I find that I can’t last longer than two hours on the silent floor, but those two hours are very productive.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Pier Room (SCE)</li>
</ol>
<p>The pier room is a place to meet with friends to go over notes before an exam or just to get some stress off by socializing and getting food from Dunkin Donuts or Argo Tea. There are some outlets, but you have to get there early to fight for them. There are also chairs and couches as well.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Circle Reading Room</li>
</ol>
<p>Saving the best for last, the circle reading room is located on the first floor of the library. It is silent, has an outlet at each desk, and also comes with a small area with couches near a fireplace. Similar to the silent floor, students come here to really zone in on their work. This is my favorite room to go to when I need to really understand a topic in isolation.</p>

<p><span class="tx f43">I’ve always wondered how people in one area of the world can be so different from</span><br />
<span class="tx">people in another. Different cultures, different values, different traditions. This wondrous feeling </span><span class="tx">arises from growing up in two very different cultures. Surprisingly, I can still vividly remember </span><span class="tx">many of my childhood experiences growing up in the city of Lahore, Pakistan. I remember the </span><span class="tx">fun times of laughing and playing with all my classmates during recess, going late-night </span><span class="tx">shopping at the beautiful bazaars, spending quality time with outgoing neighbors, and strolling </span><span class="tx">the splendid food streets. My life was perfect at that time. I was excelling in my academics. My </span><span class="tx">social life was very active. My parents had given my siblings and I so much love and support,</span><span class="tx">and our family was always there for us in occasional times of need.</span></p>
<p><span class="tx">For mostly financial reasons, my parents decided to move to the United States while I </span><span class="tx">was in the middle of fifth grade. I suddenly became pretty upset and nervous. Even the thought </span><span class="tx">of leaving all my friends and family behind made me feel depressed. To top that, I was anxious </span><span class="tx">about adjusting to a completely new lifestyle and culture. The only image I knew of the United </span><span class="tx">States was from television and movies. I had an image of harsh and snowy winters, English-</span><span class="tx">speaking Americans, and extremely luxurious houses and facilities. The adjustment was as rough </span><span class="tx">as I expected it to be. I remember the first day entering my 5th grade classroom and feeling the </span><span class="tx">constant stares and judg</span><span class="tx">men</span><span class="tx">tal looks given by my classmates. E</span><span class="tx f43">ven my teacher didn’t quite </span><span class="tx">understand that the education</span><span class="tx">al</span><span class="tx"> system in Pakistan was completely different from the</span><span class="tx"> system in </span><span class="tx">the</span><span class="tx"> United States, and as a result of this, my grades suffered for the first few months. I had never </span><span class="tx">experienced engaged classroom discussions and group projects due to the fact that in Pakistan, I </span><span class="tx">was used to learning on my own from textbooks. To top that, I had trouble making friends</span><span class="tx">,</span><span class="tx"> as my </span><span class="tx">American classmates did not share the same values as I did. For example, I was unfamiliar with </span><span class="tx">recess games and entertainment activities of the United States. I remember being constantly</span><br />
<span class="tx f43">bullied by a girl just because I didn’t wear branded and fancy clothes from Nordstrom; she told </span><span class="tx f43">me I couldn’t be part of her clique. It took me about a year to find </span><span class="tx">friends with the same values</span><span class="tx"> ,</span><span class="tx">and overcome many emotional challenges.</span></p>
<p><span class="tx">Even though the adjustment to life in the United States was very difficult, I currently feel </span><span class="tx">very grateful to have experienced growing up in two very different cultures. From the bullying </span><span class="tx">and loneliness I experienced, I have learned that I should treat everyone with kindness. I believe</span><span class="tx">I have developed some crucial problem-solving skills. I have learned to think in original and </span><span class="tx">creative ways since I have been exposed to different perspectives of many customs and </span><span class="tx">traditions. I have also gained a lot of confidence. If I can overcome the challenges of adjusting to </span><span class="tx">a completely new culture, I can overcome any unpleasant and unexpected surprises that arise in </span><span class="tx">life.</span></p>

<p>This summer, the Honors College and the Latin American and Latino Studies program are jointly sponsoring a new three-week program to the Chiapas region in Mexico led by Dr. Joel Palka, an anthropology professor and national expert in Mesoamerican history and culture. Since Palka’s first visit to the Chiapas as an undergraduate student himself, he has returned to the area five times a year in the past three decades.</p>
<p>The Chiapas is one of the most beautiful places in the world, known for its indigenous cultures and remarkable biodiversity that rivals even that of the Amazon rainforest. As Palka explained, the Lacandon Maya settled in this Southern Mexico region thousands of years ago, building marketplace infrastructure and religious shrines that remain culturally preserved today. The surrounding jungles of cedar and mahogany trees consumed the temples of Palenque when Maya presence declined, but the ruins have since been restored into a famous archeological site containing some of the finest architecture, sculptures, and relief carvings of Maya culture.</p>
<p>This study abroad experience is a great opportunity to develop an Honors Capstone project while receiving course credit for it. Jessica Santillan, a senior at UIC, is currently working with Palka on her Capstone project, eagerly planning on returning to the Chiapas through the summer program following her first trip to the region. Her research focuses on studying two unique Maya urns, one of which is located in a museum in the historic neighborhood of San Cristóbal. She collected samples to compare with the second urn, located in Michigan, and is currently working to determine the similar deity represented on both urns and find affiliated images for further examination. Other Capstone projects could also focus on researching indigenous art or health and dietary topics at the markets, including comparing indigenous markets with traditional supermarkets, researching medicinal herbs and medicines used by the Lacandon Maya, or examining local food networks.</p>
<p>Palka will lead studies observing the centuries-old Maya outdoor marketplaces where local vendors display colorful textiles, intricate woodwork and pottery. The students will explore photographic archives, interact with the local indigenous population, visit anthropology museums in San Cristóbal, and explore excavation sites. In addition to the three credits of Independent Study Research (3 credits HON 401 Advanced seminar for Honors College students), the Intro to Mexican History and Culture course will be held in cooperation with the Mexico Solidarity Network at the Autonomous University of Social Movements (AUSM), which will transfer for three additional credits at UIC. Food and housing are provided, with the dorm rooms located within the AUSM building. For Honors College students, a discounted price is provided.
