The market for vocal performance effects is currently minimal, guitar pedal rigs and laptops are powerful tools to achieve new sounds, but they limit user stage presence when repurposed for this application.

Data-flow analysis is the steering exploration mechanism along this project, allowing more exploration freedom than the traditional scheduling -based investigation, since the memory management tasks usually need only relative (rather than exact) lifetime information. Moreover, data-flow analysis enables the study of memory management tasks at the desired level of granularity -- between whole array and the scalar level -- trading-off computational effort and solution optimality.</div> <a class="read_more" href="https://www.ece.uic.edu/2002/03/18/nsf-career-award/" title="More...
