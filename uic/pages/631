UIC Fraternity and Sorority Life (FSL) welcomes all students, faculty, and staff to learn more about the history, culture, and traditions that are part of the rich and vibrant Greek community.  Student leaders from all chapters and councils will invite you to share your own understanding of what fraternity and sorority life represents and how members make an impact.  We will warmly offer individual facts from Greek history, venerated cultures, and time-honored practices, increasing awareness and knowledge of the many ways fraternity and sorority members demonstrate great care to their communities, via multiple perspectives.  Together we will learn and grow in a unified manner, by deeply caring for the celebrated diversity in all of us.

	 </div>
	 
	 <div class = "panel-body">
	 	<p>On January 9, 2018, a federal judge in California temporarily blocked the current White House administration’s decision last September to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.  DACA was started by the Obama administration in 2012 to give young undocumented immigrants protection from deportation and the ability to work legally in the U.S.  This most recent order by the Ninth Circuit judge states that the administration must resume accepting DACA renewal applications, although it does not need to accept new ones from first-time applicants.  The latest ruling gives DACA recipients a new window, albeit a temporary one, to renew their status.</p>
	 	
	 	<p>UIC Student Legal Services (SLS) is committed to helping ALL current UIC students with legal issues, including those who are personally affected by the ongoing DACA developments.  Since last November, SLS has hired two immigration attorneys to help students with such matters.  Any current student who wants to discuss the ramifications of this latest development should contact SLS to schedule an appointment.</p>
	 	
	 	<p>To make an appointment with a SLS attorney, please call 312-996-9214 or email akowal@uic.edu.  For more information on SLS, visit <a href="https://dos.uic.edu/studentlegalservices.shtml">https://dos.uic.edu/studentlegalservices.shtml</a></p>

<h3 class="h3">U &amp; I Care Responds to Title IX Changes</h3>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p><br />The Department of Education recently withdrew the previous administrations 2011 and 2014 guidance on responding to sexual misconduct reports.  It is important to note that these changes do not affect Title IX, the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), or the Illinois Preventing Sexual Assault in Higher Education Act.  These laws remain in place and they continue to protect students against gender-based misconduct.  For more information, visit the Illinois States Attorney’s Office website at: http://www.ag.state.il.us/about/index.html.<br /></p>

<p>
UIC’s current policies and procedures related to sexual or gender-based misconduct are not impacted by the Department of Education’s recent changes.  Our U&ICare partners remain committed to promoting a safe and inclusive campus environment that is free of all forms of sex discrimination, sexual violence, and sexual and gender-based harassment (collectively referred to as “sexual misconduct”). Reports of sexual misconduct will continue to be investigated and completed in a timely manner.  We will remain dedicated to the care and well-being of all students.<br> </p>
<p>As a reminder, the UIC Sexual Misconduct website provides options for reporting, on and off campus resources and other helpful information.  If you prefer to speak to a person, the following are some of our U&ICare partners available to meet or speak with you on the phone:</p>

<p>The U and I Care program is an initiative by the Office of the Dean of Students (DOS) to strengthen the University of Illinois at Chicago's network of care for students.
