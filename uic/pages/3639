In many data mining applications, the input data has a target attribute, 
which represents the objective of the application tasks. In data mining 
and machine learning, this attribute is called the class attribute. There are 
two main types of data mining involving such kind of data:
<ol>
<li> <b>Predictive data mining</b>: The objective is to build predictive 
or classification models that can be used to classify future cases.
The first type of data mining has been the focus of study of 
almost the entire machine learning community. Most commercial 
data mining tools are for this purpose too. 
<li> <b>Diagnostic data mining</b>: The aim is to understand the data 
and/or to find causes of problems and actionable knowledge in order 
to solve the problems. This type of data mining is crucial for
engineering, manufacturing and scientific applications because engineers 
and scientists want to gain new knowledge, rather than just being given a prediction.
</ol>
The second task has been studied by data mining researchers under 
the topic of interestingness, i.e., helping the user find actionable knowledge 
quickly from a large number of discovered patterns. However, through 
applications we found that existing machine learning techniques are not 
really suitable to the second task, while existing interestingness 
methods are not sufficient either. We had to build a different 
kind of data mining system for Motorola as commercial data mining
systems do not fit their needs. The reason is that they cannot perform 
the second task well, while the second task is the key problem of the 
entire engineering/manufacturing industry, where product improvement 
is the essence. Data mining is needed to identify product problems and 
their causes (no prediction is needed). 
<p>We were also surprised to find that current rule mining paradigm 
(classification rule mining or association rule mining) itself poses a 
major obstacle to interestingness analysis, which makes it difficult 
for finding actionable knowledge. We discovered that
<ul>
<li>Each individual rule is not a piece of knowledge by itself. It can only be a piece of interesting knowledge in an implicit or explicit context. 
<li>Individual rules may not be interesting, but a group of them may 
represent an important piece of knowledge. Meta-mining is thus needed to mine more generalized knowledge, e.g., trends. An old idea called "<i>general impressions</i>" that we proposed in KDD-07 turned out to be so useful. 
</ul>
<p> Due to shortcomings of the existing 
methods, we have designed a set of new techniques to perform the second 
task. They are based on two novel ideas, <i><b>rule cubes</b></i> and <i><b>general impressions</b></i>. Our system, called <b><a href="http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/diagnosticDM/OM.JPG">Opportunity Map</a></b>, has been deployed and is in daily use in Motorola. The first version of the system was deployed around Dec 2005. As of June 15 2006, it was used to analyze 11 large data sets for entirely different applications 
from Motorola's world wide operations, e.g., finding causes of call 
performance problems and solving them, supply chain analyses, network characterization, business 
opportunities, etc. Some applications involve continuous analyses as 
new data comes in. Many pieces of discovered 
knowledge have already been used in Motorola's new products. The system is also
commercially available. Some of the techniques have been discussed in the following papers. 
The first paper is more reserach oriented and the second paper focuses more
on the Motorola application.
