Millions of people around the world die from non-communicable diseases that could have been diagnosed and treated. Although these conditions are often thought of as a rural phenomenon, many people living in urban poverty cannot afford health treatment or care and there are few nonprofits available to work toward a solution for them. Motivated to solve this global problem, Honors College student Rahul Patel will join a UIC team of four other students in the annual competition for the Hult Prize on March 7-8th in San Francisco. The Hult Prize serves as an opportunity for aspiring students from universities across the nation to come together and solve serious issues faced by billions of people worldwide. The 2014 Hult Prize winner will be chosen by former President Bill Clinton on behalf of the Clinton Global Initiative, which encourages students to develop solutions to improve care for people living in impoverished urban areas worldwide.</p>
<p>Participants in the Hult Competition form teams of four to five people within their university and submit an application. After the first round of the competition narrowed the field from 10,000 to 300 teams, this year’s UIC team qualified for the regional competition in California. This is one of six regional competitions at which teams will give their presentations. One team will be</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>chosen from each of the regional competitions to move on to the final competition, which will be hosted by the Clinton Global Initiative’s annual meeting in September 2014. The winning team will receive $1,000,000 awarded by former President Clinton himself to implement their healthcare solutions and change the lives of people around the world.</p>
<p>The members of the UIC team, including Patel, will present their idea to implement health kiosks in urban areas where people cannot afford healthcare. Their idea—called “Qube”— will reflect a business model that aims to bring down the cost of healthcare as well as diagnose and treat non-communicable diseases more efficiently for people who cannot ordinarily afford treatment.</p>
<p>Honors College Dean Bette L. Bottoms stated proudly that, “to be among only 300 teams chosen from 10,000 who entered this worthwhile competition is extraordinary. But it is not unexpected—UIC students are every bit as prepared and creative as their competition from Stanford, Harvard, and other universities of historical prominence, but [are] far more engaged with and understanding of today’s socially significant problems, especially those that are health-related.” Best of luck to Rahul and the UIC team at the regional competition!</p>

<p>With today’s economy, it is easy to overlook opportunities like studying abroad. Many students may wonder who has the time or budget to visit another country for an entire semester. Fortunately, there exists a scholarship that assists hard-working students from low-income families in paying for their study abroad experiences. The Gilman Program is invested in providing study abroad opportunities for traditionally underrepresented student groups with each award averaging $4,000. In order to be eligible for the Gilman Scholarship a student must demonstrate an excellent academic history and be a Federal Pell Grant recipient.</p>
<p>The Gilman Scholarship was the determining factor as to whether or not I could go abroad, and without it I would not have been able to spend my Fall 2013 semester in Barcelona, Spain conducting research on cross-cultural perspectives for the treatment of various mental illnesses. The lessons learned abroad are so incredibly valuable that no amount of credit hours can account for them. For example, we touched on theories of cultural relativism in my psychology classes and I was able to concretely put these theories into practice while interacting with locals on a day-to-day basis. It was the application of these concepts that made the lessons all the more effective and relevant to my future Capstone project.</p>
<p>With opportunities like the Gilman Scholarship, we are reminded that studying abroad is an experience that no student should feel excluded from. If you are interested in studying abroad there are a variety of scholarships available to all students, including through the Honors College. Visit the Study Abroad Office website for more details: http://www.uic.edu/depts/spec_prog/studyabroad/</p>

<p>This past summer, I had the opportunity to study abroad with the School for International<br />
Training (SI T) World Learning to study various forms of traditional medicine that flourish in parts of Northern India. I encountered a spectrum of alternative medical systems, including faith-based healing, yoga, reflexology, Ayurveda, naturopathy, and Tibetan medicine. Most of these Eastern medical systems are more than 5,000 years old, yet they coexist with conventional medicine in parts of Asia. A universal underpinning of these alternative systems of medicine is the belief that<br />
the human body has innate healing capacities, and the purpose of medicine should be to augment those capacities through natural and holistic means, instead of ingesting potent drugs or using invasive means of treatment.</p>
<div>
<p>My SIT group first traveled to rural Nanital where we lived with the villagers and explored traditional faith-based healing prevalent in remote areas. We observed how practitioners and patients alike perceived mantra-based healing and the scope of its effects.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we traveled to Rishikesh, dubbed “the yoga capital of the world,” to learn about the philosophy and practice of yoga. I learned that the difference between more strenuous forms of exercise and yoga is that the former focus on movement, and the latter focuses on stillness. Aerobic exercises enlarge muscle mass by creating micro-tears in muscle fibers, whereas yoga postures, with their emphasis on flexibility, strengthen and tone the muscles, thereby carrying the effect beyond the tissues and into the organs. Moreover, I was able to experience the application of yoga in a clinical setting. Many physicians in India prescribe certain yoga poses to supplement the treatment of certain diseases. For example, diabetic patients are advised to perform yoga postures that stretch the abdominal region, such as the cobra and butterfly postures, because exerting pressure on the abdominal region enhances circulation to that area, stimulating the pancreas to secrete insulin.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>My group also shadowed at a prestigious hospital in Palampur, the Kayakalp Institute, where all treatments offered were drugless. I learned about thousands of herbs and spices and their medicinal properties, and about the therapeutic effects of massages and mud</p>

<p>My group also shadowed at a prestigious hospital in Palampur, the Kayakalp Institute, where all treatments offered were drugless. I learned about thousands of herbs and spices and their medicinal properties, and about the therapeutic effects of massages and mud therapies in Ayurveda and naturopathy. Moreover, learning the basis of reflexology uncovered the mystery of why foot massages are so relaxing.</p>
<p>Our last excursion was to Dharamsala, a city in the foothills of the Himalayas where the Dalai Lama and the exiled Tibetan government reside. Tibetan medicine is closely intertwined with Buddhist philosophy, and practitioners of this system believe that all of us are sick until we surpass all forms of ignorance. Even if there is no conspicuous physical illness, ignorance gives rise to mental illness, and states of anger, desire, and other afflictive emotions are considered in Tibetan medicine to be reflective of one’s mental health.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>My experiences this past summer have shaped my understanding of medicine as a dynamic anthropological creation. When we think about health, we are accustomed to thinking in terms of disease. But, I’ve come to realize that health is not merely the absence of disease, and that a holistic conception of health is necessary in treating the entire gamut of human afflictions. I am eternally grateful to the Gilman Scholarship, the Foundation for Global Scholars, the UIC Asian American Native American and Pacific Islander-Serving Institution (AANAAPISI) Scholarship Program, the UIC Honors College, and SIT for making my trip possible and affording me this great opportunity.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">This October, the UIC Honors College won a $40,000 scholarship through a Facebook contest sponsored by Allie’s Friends Foundation. The foundation was established in memory of Allie Dowd,who tragically passed away in 2004 at the age of nine as the result of a horseback riding accident. The foundation now provides stuffed animals to ambulance squads and emergency rooms, including University of Illinois Hospital on west campus, in order to offer comfort to children in emergency medical situations.</span></p>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Allie Dowd Memorial Scholarship Fund was created in the Honors College by Allie’s parents, Diane and Brian Dowd, to honor what would have been Allie’s first year of college. Allie’s sister and cousins donated sweatshirts from their respective alma maters to a Facebook contest in which the public was invited to show their school spirit by “liking” the sweatshirt of their choice. Allie’s cousin, Jennifer Borland (class of 2002), donated a UIC Flames sweatshirt, and the support from UIC students, faculty, and alumni started pouring in. The UIC sweatshirt got over 1,350 “likes,” far more than any of the other 14 schools that participated. In recognition of UIC’s spirit and dedication, the Dowds will donate a $10,000 scholarship to a single Honors College student, renewable for four years. “The Honors College is very grateful to Diane and Brian Dowd for their generosity,” said Lisa Domkowski, the Director of Advancement at the UIC Honors College.</p>
<p>With this scholarship, Allie’s Friends is expanding their already profound impact. On the foundation’s Facebook page, one mother wrote about her daughter who was having difficulty breathing and was in hysterics in the emergency room; she only calmed down when a stuffed dog from Allie’s Friends was brought to her. Many parents share similar stories and express their gratitude.</p>
