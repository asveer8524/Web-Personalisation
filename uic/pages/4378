<p> <b>Open world machine learning</b> (a.k.a. <b>open world classification</b> or <b>open classification)</b> is getting increasingly important as the learning agent is increasingly working in the <b>real-world open and dynamic environment</b>, e.g., chatbot and self-driving car, where the agent cannot expect 
what it will see in the real-world are what it has learned previously. The real-world is full of unknowns.  

<p> Classic machine learning makes the <i><b>closed world assumption</b></i>, i.e., the classes that the agent sees in training are what it will see in testing (no new classes can appear in testing) (Fei and Liu 2016). A more realistic scenario is to expect <b>unseen classes</b> during testing (open world). In this case, the goal is to design a learning algorithm that can classify data of the known classes into their respective classes and also to reject/detect instances from unknown classes. This problem is called <b>open-world classification (or open-world learning)</b>. Apart from detecting the unseen classes, we also want to incrementally learn the new classes. An open world learner should be able to do the following:

<ul>
<li> traditional close-world classification (assuming test instances are from only the training/seen classes), 
<li> detecting or rejecting instances of unseen classes - not seen in training (the <b>DOC algorithm</b> (<a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/publications/emnlp17-camera-ready.pdf">EMNLP-2017</a>) is very powerful for this task for both text and images), 
<li> autmatically detecting unseen classes in the rejected instances based on the knowledge learned in the past (Shu et al., 2018), and
<li> incrementally learning the new/unseen classes (Fei et al., 2016). 
</ul>
<p>In the process, the system accumulates more and more knowledge (Fei et al., 2016). 
The learner is <i>self-motivated</i> and <i>it knows what it does and does not know.</i> With intelligent systems such as chatbots and self-driving cars increasingly facing the real-world open (unknown) environments, we can no longer make the <b>closed world assumption</b>.
