<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
<p>A huge amount of data on the Web may be heterogeneous with respect to syntax, schemata and semantics. For instance, XML and RDF provide two completely different paradigms for modeling Web data. In this paper, we focus on the issue of mapping representations in an ontology-based framework that aims at integrating XML and RDF sources. We propose a solution that utilizes a new mapping language called RDF Mapping Schema, which is a meta-schema defined on top of RDF Schema.</p>
