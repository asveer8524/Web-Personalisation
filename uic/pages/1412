<p>
This project studies automatic (and semi-automatic) extraction of 
structured data from Web pages. 
Each of such pages may contain a single or several groups of structured data records, which
could be flat or nested. These data records are usually retrieved from underlying databases and displayed on Web pages following some fixed templates. 
Examples of such data records include, products 
sold online, research publications, job postings, customer reviews, and many many more. 
The objective of this project is to design and experiment novel algorithms 
to extract such data and put them in database tables. We have proposed 
several fully automatic approaches based on tree matching and a semi-automatic instance based learning approach.

<p>Download <A Href="http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/WebDataExtraction/MDR-download.html"> the <font color=#ff0000>MDR</font> system</a> here. Two new systems are <font color=#ff0000>DEPTA</font> and <font color=#ff0000>NET</font>. 
<p>Techniques and ideas in the systems and the papers below have been used by
several companies.  
<ul><li> E.g., the instance-based learning method in (Zhai and Liu, 2005 and 2007) has been implemented by <a href="https://github.com/scrapy/scrapely">github.com</a> and is in commerical use. The company said "with some tweaks and extentions it has been used on thousands of websites, extracting millions of items." If you are interested, you can download their code. 
<li> <font color="red">DEPTA</font> has been reimplemented by Sigit Dewanto (with some changes), you can download it from <a href="http://seagatesoft.blogspot.com/2012/05/structured-data-extractor.html">here</a>. The source is available <a href="https://github.com/seagatesoft/sde/">here</a>
