<h3>Security</h3><p>
<P>
Our projects in security are broadly focussed in two directions. The
first direction is on  exploring model checking based techniques for
analyzing access control policies and for verifying security
properties of programs. The second direction is towards developing
program transformation techniques for preventing leakage of
confidential information.

Currently there is much interest in analyzing properties of Trust Management 
Systems. SPKI/SDSI is a system for issuing authorization and name certificates.
It can be used to implement a Trust Management System, where the policy for 
resource access is distributedly specified by multiple trusted entities. 
Agents in the system need a formal mechanism for understanding the current 
state of the policy. We present a first order temporal logic, called FTPL,
for specifying properties of a given SPKI/SDSI policy state. We also present
algorithms to check if a SPKI/SDSI policy state satisfies a property specified
in FTPL.


<P>Dynamic policy is a scheme where a policy changes dynamically with time or 
system state. The following paper presents a number of results on dynamic 
policy analysis. In particular, it presents a frame work for modeling dynamic 
policies using structures. It also presents a logic FCTL which is an extension
of CTL with first order quantifiers for specifying correctness properties of 
dynamic policies. The first order quantifiers range over principals.
It presents a number of results when the dynamic policy is specified in RT0
language with role restrictions. It shows that checking universal role 
containment for full RT0 language is EXPTIME-complete. It also shows that 
checking properties of the form AG(f) where f is positive or negative first 
order formula can be done in polynomial time (here, AG(f) asserts that in 
all reachable states f is satisfied). Finally, it shows how traditional model checking based approaches can be used to analyze finite state dynamic policies
or policies that change over time.

The other projects in security explore the topics such as string analysis based on symbolic evaluation to enforce security properties,verifying security properties in java virtual machines and prevention of information leaks.
