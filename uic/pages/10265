<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" color=#ffc63e size=2>Amy partipated in an information 
visualization project. She contributed to the implementation of a tailorable 
interface using a novel layered architecture. She will soon start applying to 
medical school after completing the necessary pre-med studies at UIC.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" color=#ffc63e size=2>Dhira and Krupa worked on data 
integration in the medical domain. In particular, they investigated algorithms 
that generate ontologies with the purpose of testing alignment techniques. Dhira 
will be graduating in December and will be soon looking for an interesting job. 
Krupa will also be looking for a job after an exciting intermission in 
India.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" color=#ffc63e size=2>Rupal's research focus was on sensor 
networks. She took part in an experimental setup for testing a new query 
language. Rupal will be using her database expertise on a job before returning 
to UIC for her graduate studies.</FONT></P>
