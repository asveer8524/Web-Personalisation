Data Mining and Text Mining
</center>
</H2>
<br> 

<H3> Course Objective and Organization </h3>
<p>This course has three objectives. First, to provide students with a sound basis in data mining tasks and techniques. Second, to ensure that students are able to read, present and critically evaluate data mining research papers. Third, to ensue that students are able to implement and to use some of the important data mining and text mining algorithms. 
<p>This course is organized in nine (9) sections, which cover all the main topics of data mining and text mining. For each topic, the instructor will first give a few introductory lectures first. Then, the class will discuss some research papers. Each class discussion starts with a paper presentation (in a seminar format) by a student assigned to read and present the paper. Two programming assignments will be given to ensure that students are able to implement and use some important data mining techniques.

<li> Midterm: 30% -- It consists of two parts
<ul> 
<li> Date: Oct 20
<li> normal sit-in paper test (same time and same location as our Monday class).
<li> demo the use of C4.5 and CBA (in my office from 2:00pm to 6:00pm, the same day).
    I will give you a dataset already in the right format with both training and 
    testing data, you are expected to run, c4.5, c4.5rule and CBA to produce the 
    error rate on the test set. The dataset may have continuous attributes.

</ol>
<H3> Programming Projects - graded  (you will demo your program to me)</H3>
<p> For both programming projects, you should use exactly the same file format as C4.5 and CBA. 
<ol>
<li> Implement a naive bayesian classifier:
<ul>
<li> Input: input files format should be the same as C4.5 and CBA. 
<li> Output: given a training dataset and the test set, your program 
     should output a confusion matrix and also the accuracy on the
     test set. 
<li> You can use C4.5 or CBA's example datasets for testing.
<li> You can ignore any missing values as we discussed in class.
<li> Regarding smoothing, please see this <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~pazzani/Publications/mlj97-pedro.pdf">paper (page 107)</a>
<li> If a dataset has continuous attributes, you can use CBA's 
     discretizer to discretize these attributes. 
<li> You can use any programming language you want. If the language
     that you use is not available on the department machine
     (bert.cs.uic.edu). You need to bring your laptop 
     to my office to demo to me later. 
<li> Deadline: Oct 27, 2003. 
</ul> 
<li> Implement the k-mean algorithm
<ul>
<li> Input: input file format should be the same as C4.5 and CBA. 
     We assume that every attribute is continuous. There is
     no missing value. Use Euclidean distance as the similarity 
     measure. 
<li> Output: Print the centriod and the number
     of data points in each cluster. Store the actual data points of 
     each cluster in a separate file. 
<li> You MUST make sure that one can manually select a few data 
     points as the seeds. That is, I can tell your program to 
     use some data points as the initial seeds, e.g., data point 
     1, 5, 3, 8. 
<li> You can use some continuous data from CBA's example datasets 
     for testing. You should also make up a small dataset to check
     whether your clustering is correct. 
<li> You can use any programming language you want. If the language
     that you use is not available on the department machine
     (bert.cs.uic.edu). You need to bring your laptop 
     to my office to demo to me later. 
<li> Deadline: Nov 26, 2003. 
</ul>
</ol>

<H3> Paper presentation - graded </H3> 
<ul> 
<Li>Students will read research papers and present the main ideas or
techniques of the papers in the class. 
<li>Students will read papers in groups. Each group have two students and will focus on one paper. Each group will also do a presentation on the paper. Both students in the group are expected to share the presentation and to answer questions during the presentation. Each presentation will last 35 minutes (30 minutes talk and 5 minutes questions & answers)
<li> Please form your own group by Sept 10, 2003. 
<li> Presentation schedule (subject to change): Two groups
will present in each class. Please prepare your slides for the overhead projector.

<H3> Rules and Policies </H3> 
<uL>
<li> <b>Statute of limitations</b>: No grading questions or complaints, no matter how justified, will be listened to one week after the item in question has been returned. 
<li> <b>Cheating</b>: Cheating will not be tolerated. All work you submitted must be entirely your own. Any suspicious similarities between students' work (this includes, exams and program) will be recorded and brought to the attention of the Dean. The MINIMUM penalty for any student found cheating will be to receive a 0 for the item in question, and dropping your final course grade one letter. The MAXIMUM penalty will be expulsion from the University. 
<li> <b>MOSS</b>: Sharing code with your classmates is not acceptable!!! All programs will be screened using the Moss (Measure of Software Similarity.) system. 
<li> <b>Late assignments</b>: Late assignments will not, in general, be accepted. They will never be accepted if the student has not made special arrangements with me at least one day before the assignment is due. If a late assignment is accepted it is subject to a reduction in score as a late penalty.
