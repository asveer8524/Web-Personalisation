Has published more than 180 papers and 1 graduate textbook; his publications appeared in journals such as JACM, ACM TODS, IEEE TKDE, IEEE Transactions on Computers,
IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering and ACM Transactions on Information Systems and conference papers such as ACM SIGMOD, VLDB, ACM SIGIR, WWW and CIKM;  received funds from NSF for the last 27 years, since returning to the US in 1978; other funding sources include government agencies such as AFOSR, Argonne National Laboratory, ARO and NOSC and companies such as Hughes Aircraft, Omron Corporation and OCLC; served as an advisory committee member for NSF, program committee chair for ACM SIGIR Conference, chair of the ACM SIGIR society, conference co-chair of a number of conferences and workshops. He will serve as the general chair for the ACM SIGMOD  2006 conference; served as member of editorial board/associate editor for several journals such as IEEE TKDE and WWW: <i>Internet and Web Information Systems</i>.

Based on his research results, two start-up companies: Webscalers and PharmIR have been formed. Webscalers is a  metasearch engine company with the aim of providing search facility for the Web. Unlike search engine such as Google ad Yahoo, a metasearch engine connects to numerous search engines and therefore should be able to provide more coverage of the Web as well as more up-to-date information. A prototype metasearch engine produced by the company for retrieving news items can be found at <a href="http://www.allinonenews.com">www.allinonenews.com</a>  NSF SBIR funds have been received to support this effort. PharmIR aims to reduce drug product confusion as people have been harmed by taking the wrong drugs which have look-alike or sound-alike names. A commercial system has been developed and is being used by several drug companies. It has received NIH SBIR funds to continue the research and development effort.
