<h2><a id="jpite2018"></a>Announce the appointment of Dr. Shelie Miller as director of the Joint Program in the Environment (JPitE) at the University of Michigan</h2>
<h2><a href="https://iesp.uic.edu/files/2015/07/Dr-Miller.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1824 alignright" src="https://iesp.uic.edu/files/2015/07/Dr-Miller.jpg" alt="" width="214" height="318" srcset="https://iesp.uic.edu/files/2015/07/Dr-Miller.jpg 400w, https://iesp.uic.edu/files/2015/07/Dr-Miller-202x300.jpg 202w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" /></a></h2>
<p><strong><em>Shelie Miller will succeed Dr. Gregg Crane, director of PitE, whose appointment ends June 30, 2018. We extend our sincere gratitude to Gregg for his service and strong leadership. We also thank the JPitE faculty for their help in this transition.</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit;font-size: inherit">Shelie is co-chair with Dr. Adam Simon of the Joint Program in the Environment Transition Advisory Committee. During Fall 2017, the committee helped assemble the initial governing faculty of JPitE and drafted bylaws for the new program. The committee will continue to work throughout the semester on a comprehensive set of recommendations on curriculum and student experience, including how to improve course offerings, and how best to connect JPitE students with SEAS master’s and doctoral students, faculty, staff, alumni, and partners. Shelie will bring this knowledge and experience to her new role as program director.</span></p>
<p>As a scholar, Shelie has a strong commitment to interdisciplinary work and integrating research into education and outreach. Her research identifies potential unintended environmental consequences of emerging technologies and finds possible design or policy interventions that will lead to sustainable outcomes. She recently returned to Ann Arbor from Washington, D.C., where she was a 2016-2017 Jefferson Science Fellow through the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. She has received a Presidential Early Career Award in Science and Engineering (PECASE) from President Obama and was recognized as a Kavli Frontiers Fellow by the National Academy of Sciences. She serves in a variety of advisory roles for government, non-government, and academic entities.</p>

<h2><a id="WalletHub17"></a>Jane Lin was featured in WalletHub&#8217;s recent piece about the best and worst cities to drive in</h2>
<p>Most Americans rely on cars to get around. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, “87 percent of daily trips take place in personal vehicles.” And even with growing access to public transportation in U.S. cities, most people still choose to travel by car, mainly for reasons such as “comfort and reliability.”</p>
<p>In truth, however, driving is often a major hassle and expense. Drivers annually spend an average of 200 hours on the road, plus another 41 hours in gridlock. For a full-time worker, that’s the equivalent of a six-week vacation. Add the costs of wasted time and fuel due to traffic congestions, and our collective tab comes to about $124 billion annually, or $1,700 per household. That figure doesn’t even include the additional $515 expense for maintenance and repairs, which many of us are likely to spend given the poor quality of America’s roads — currently ranking No. 14 out of 140 economically developed nations, according to the World Economic Forum, and graded “D” by the American Society of Civil Engineers.</p>
<p>But some cities are better for those behind the wheel. To determine those places, WalletHub’s analysts compared the 100 largest cities across 25 key indicators of driver-friendliness. Our data set ranges from average gas prices to average annual hours of traffic delays to auto-repair shops per capita. Read on for our findings, tips and insight from a panel of experts, and a full description of our methodology.</p>

<p><a href="https://iesp.uic.edu/files/2015/07/Pic.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1792 alignright" src="https://iesp.uic.edu/files/2015/07/Pic-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://iesp.uic.edu/files/2015/07/Pic-300x200.jpg 300w, https://iesp.uic.edu/files/2015/07/Pic-150x100.jpg 150w, https://iesp.uic.edu/files/2015/07/Pic-200x133.jpg 200w, https://iesp.uic.edu/files/2015/07/Pic-250x166.jpg 250w, https://iesp.uic.edu/files/2015/07/Pic.jpg 684w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The new interdisciplinary grant, “Political Ecology as Practice: A Regional Approach to the Anthropocene,” connects scholars in the humanities and the natural sciences. The PI is Ömür Harmanşah, and Co-PI’s are Molly Doane, David Wise, Ralf Cintron (Latin American and Latino Studies, and English) and Beate Geissler (Art). A large portion of the funds will be used to support the work of five UIC graduate students: Javairia Shahid (Art History), Tannya Islas (Latin American and Latino Studies), Katy Dye (Anthropology), Alize Arican (Athropology) and Charlie Corwin (Urban Planning and Policy). The UIC group is collaborating with a geographer at the Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison, Ian Baird, and his graduate students.</p>
<p>A major goal of IESP is to foster collaboration across disciplines. Bridging the gap between the natural sciences and the humanities has been a challenge, but not an insurmountable one. One example of a recent success is awarding of a research grant to UIC faculty by Humanities Without Walls (HWW), a consortium of 15 universities, in response to the HWW call for proposals on “The Work of the Humanities in a Changing Climate.” The genesis of the successful proposal can be traced to the interchange of ideas between members of the UIC Institute of the Humanities Political Ecologies Working Group formed in late 2015 by Ömür Harmanşah (Art History) and Molly Doane (Anthropology).</p>
<p>David Wise, IESP Assoc. Director, has participated in the working group since its inception. “At the University of Kentucky I was part of the Social Theory Graduate Program, so when I received the invitation from Ömür and Molly to join the group (its official name is “Political Ecologies: Nature, Place, Heritage”) I jumped at the chance,” says Prof. Wise. He continues that “I joined the group because I was eager to interact with colleagues from the humanities and social sciences, and also because even though I am an ecologist, I really had no idea what Molly and Ömür meant by ‘political ecologies’”. Wise adds that “it turns out that the group has been forging a definition since the first day we met &#8212; which is what collaboration across the disciplines is all about.”</p>
<p>Harmanşah explains that “this project investigates reciprocal relationships between emergent theories of the Anthropocene, climate change, and the global environmental crisis. The project will investigate how these theories incorporate insights from regional ecological conflicts, and how these theories themselves impact various communities in terms of their relationship with land, resources and biodiversity. The initial phase involves fieldwork, developed from existing projects, in northern Illinois and Chicago as well as regions of Pakistan, Turkey, Cambodia, Mexico and Bolivia. The field initiatives will consist of observations, visual documentation, interviews, and creative interventions such as public engagement events and art installations. Results will be presented in publications, and lectures and workshops at UIC.” The project’s PI adds that “in addition, two graduate fellows will curate a project exhibition in UIC’s Gallery 400 that will represent each field initiative in mixed-media (posters, photography and video).</p>
<p>The first formal gathering of the project will be a week-long Fall 2017 workshop and conference at UIC funded by the Institute for the Humanities, the School of Art and Art History, and the Institute for Environmental Science and Policy.</p>

<h2>Associate Research Professor was awarded a new NSF grant</h2>
<p>Associate Research Professor Jane Lin received a new NSF grant entitled “Smart CROwdsourced Urban Delivery (CROUD) System”. Total funding for the project is $1,000,000, and UIC’s share is $320,000 over three years.</p>
<p>NSF PFI:BIC &#8211; Smart CROwdsourced Urban Delivery (CROUD) System<br />
Duration: 9/1/2015-8/31/2018<br />
Amount: $1,000,000 (UIC subaward: $320,000)<br />
PI: Yu (Marco) Nie, Northwestern University<br />
co-PIs: Jane Lin (UIC), Jim Schummer (NU), Ouri Wolfson (UIC), Amanda Stathopoulos (NU)<br />
Industrial partner: Zipments</p>
<p>Abstract: The thesis of the CROUD is the ability, enabled by recent advances in communication and ubiquitous mobile computing, to match highly fragmented transport capacities with vastly diverse demand for urban deliveries, temporally, spatially and in real-time. The project will build on collaboration between a CROUD-based technology firm, Zipments, and two research universities, Northwestern University (NU) and University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), to develop intelligence necessary to integrate the CROUD technology into a human-centered smart urban delivery service system. The proposed partnership will assemble a team that consists of Zipments’ technical group (including its CEO and co-founders) and five researchers of diverse expertise. The envisioned smart CROUD system will integrate four subsystems that encapsulate, respectively, pricing/matching mechanisms, consumer/courier management strategies, collaborative delivery/routing algorithms and real-time data collection and analysis tools. Prototypes of the new system will be implemented and evaluated based on the CROUD platform currently operated by Zipments.</td>

<h2>ORISE opportunity in the EPA&#8217;s Office of Research and Development, National Center for Environmental Assessment</h2>
<p>EPA is advertising a new PhD level ORISE opportunity in the EPA&#8217;s Office of Research and Development, National Center for Environmental Assessment. This will involve working with various federal agencies and researchers to assess and analyze research efforts focused on reactive nitrogen (Nr). This will involve an interdisciplinary team including researchers in ecology, atmospheric sciences, agriculture, hydrology, and economics, among others, to synthesize our understanding of Nr in the U.S. and promote its sustainable management. Motivation for this opportunity partially stemmed from a multi-agency workshop in June 2014, the Abstract of which is copied below. There will also be opportunities for individual research projects focused on a variety of topics, including critical loads of atmospheric deposition, climate change impacts and adaptation, interactions between carbon and nitrogen cycles, urban ecology, and quantification of ecosystem services, depending on the Fellow&#8217;s area of expertise and interest.</p>
<p><strong>ORISE url:</strong> Click <a href="http://orise.orau.gov/epa/applicants/description.aspx?JobId=18387" target="_blank">Here</a></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In June 2014, scientists and managers from government, academia, NGOs and the private sector came together to review the science and management related to reactive nitrogen and co-pollutants (e.g. phosphorus, sulfur) across the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The purpose of the meeting was to develop a collaborative research and management partnership between USDA, USGS and EPA, in order to promote sustainable management of reactive nitrogen. Achieving our common goals of improving air and water quality, food security, and human health and welfare will require coordination of research, policies and management across a variety of Federal agencies, and this workshop identified a number of key areas of future coordination. An outcome of this meeting is the formation of a collaborative relationship between EPA, USGS and USDA that advances reactive N research to inform science based management, improves communications, and recommends alternative approaches to managing N in an integrated framework.</td>

Graduates leave as thoughtful and informed global citizens with a firm foundation and expanded network for careers in sustainability, energy, and smart technology and infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>2015 Theme: Digital Rebirth</strong><br />
Digital technology now allows us to capture the dynamics of entire systems, from manufacturing lines to the electricity grid to the flow of people, cars, water, and waste. Given the need to service concentrated population clusters, cities in particular can take advantage of digital technology and the Internet of Things to improve systems delivering energy, water, and transportation. Yet this requires addressing such challenges as retrofitting or replacing aging infrastructure, data collection and management, privacy issues, cybersecurity risks, and the formation of new business and financing models.</p>
<p>SISE will</p>
<ol>
<li>explore the crossroads of digital manufacturing, smart cities, and energy;</li>
<li>dive deep into specific applications such as smart grid and the connected vehicle; and</li>
<li>theorize how these innovations can usher in a more sustainable future. Topics will revolve around integration; sourcing and use of supply; reduction of waste; energy and resource demands; big data collection and use; anticipation, reaction, and adaptation to the unexpected; and sensors, connectivity, and cybersecurity.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Now Accepting Applications</strong><br />
Admission into the program is highly competitive, drawing from a national pool of applicants. Applicants accepted into the program can expect to receive lodging support for the duration of the 2-week program and some meals on weekdays. Many will receive partial support for travel costs.</p>

<h2><a id="predocfellow5" name="proposal"></a>CALL FOR PROPOSALS: ILLINOIS SUSTAINABLE TECHNOLOGY CENTER</h2>
<p><em>February 2014</em></p>
<p>The Illinois Sustainable Technology Center (ISTC), a division of the Prairie Research Institute at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is announcing a call for proposals. ISTC conducts research and technical assistance in the areas of pollution prevention; energy conservation and new energy technologies; biofuels; waste reduction; water quality improvements; and water use and reuse. ISTC administers its Sponsored Research Grant Program to advance the state of knowledge/practice in areas of sustainability, pollution prevention, energy generation and conservation, and environmental issues of importance to the State. In FY15, proposals are being requested for projects that will contribute to ISTC&#8217;s goal of conserving a total of one billion gallons of water in the state of Illinois. Projects can be focused on methods for reducing water use; treatment of wastewater or other process water for reuse; novel recycling methods; or other significant water-saving measures. Technologies or practices that are easily transferable to other industries or businesses are preferred. Projects that target significant water savings through energy savings will also be considered. Projects should be able to achieve real measurable water savings/conservation within the time frame of the project or be able to show a very high potential for significant water savings/conservation in the near future. Funded projects will be used as case studies by ISTC to provide information to other entities about sustainable water-saving/conservation practices and technologies.

<h2><a id="greenfee" name="greenfee"></a>REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS FOR FUNDING BY THE UIC GREEN FEE</h2>
<p><em>September 5, 2013</em></p>
<p>In 2011, the Board of Trustees approved the UIC Green Fee as an initiative to improve the quality of campus operations, reduce UIC&#8217;s environmental impact, and, most importantly, generate awareness about environmental issues by creating opportunities for students&#8217; involvement. Paid for by all professional, graduate and undergraduate students, the Green Fee will be used to enroll UIC in the Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s Green Power Partnership Program, which requires UIC to purchase a minimum of 3% of its total electricity purchases from renewable energy sources. Furthermore, the fee will also be used to fully fund small, short-term projects, as well as subsidizing larger, long-term projects.</p>
<p>Currently, the Green Fee Advisory Board (GFAB) is requesting proposals to fund sustainability, energy efficiency and conservation, and/or renewable energy projects on campus. Approximately $150,000 is available to support proposals in 2013-2014 that help increase the use of clean energy technologies on campus and that aid in establishing a sustainable campus environment by expanding such areas as composting, landscaping, or transportation initiatives, while also reducing waste and conserving resources. This is separate from the funding of the Green Power program. Funding proposals must address the three pillars of sustainability &#8211; environmental protection, social equity, and economic benefit &#8211; and align with the goals of the UIC Climate Action Plan. While we recognize that all projects will have capital costs included in their budgets, the fee is considered a genuine extension of UIC&#8217;s sustainability commitment and should not be intended as a substitute for university budget cuts.</p>
<p>For questions regarding the guidelines and the application, please contact <a href="mailto:UICGFAB@uic.edu">UICGFAB@uic.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Letter of Inquiry Deadline: September 20, 2013<br />
Final Proposal Deadline: November 15, 2013</p>

<h2>USC RELEASES CLIMATE CHANGE AND YOUR HEALTH REPORT, AFTER THE STORM: THE HIDDEN HEALTH RISKS OF FLOODING IN A WARMING WORLD</h2>
<p><em>April 3, 2012</em></p>
<p>Over the past 30 years, floods have tended to be one of the most deadly and expensive type of natural disaster in the United States. The impact of a flood is typically measured in terms of lives lost and the dollar value of property damaged or destroyed. But the often-substantial public health costs that follow a flood—and the toll that such health impacts may take on families even long after the waters have receded—are rarely included. Heavy rains or storm surges can contaminate drinking and recreational water with sewage, agricultural waste, chemical pollutants, or animal wastes, leading to waterborne gastrointestinal illnesses. Flooded homes and buildings can be a breeding ground for mold, which can cause debilitating respiratory and neurological problems. Mental health problems also tend to increase in the wake of extreme weather disasters.</p>
<p>Extreme rainfall events have become more common in the United States during the same period that the climate has warmed, and it is likely that this trend will continue as temperatures rise. The Midwest region has experienced a 31% increase in the number of extreme precipitation events over the last 50 years.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://iesp.uic.edu/news/UCS_AfterTheStorm_final.pdf" target="_blank">After the Storm: The Hidden Health Risks of Flooding in a Warming World</a></em>, a new report from the <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/" target="_blank">Union of Concerned Scientists</a> (USC), discusses the health hazards posed by extreme precipitation and flooding and what can be done to protect families, particularly those who are at greatest risk. Next, it addresses other flooding risk factors, such as where and how we choose to develop. Finally, the report summarizes the evidence linking climate change to the increased risk of weather events that can lead to flooding.</p>

<h2>SAMUEL DOREVITCH PUBLISHES RESULTS OF THE CHEERS STUDY: HEALTH RISKS OF LIMITED-CONTACT WATER RECREATION</h2>
<p><em>November 3, 2011</em></p>
<p>IESP joint faculty, Samuel Dorevitch, published the results of the Chicago Health, Environmental Exposure, and Recreation Study (CHEERS) “Health Risks of Limited-contact Water Recreation” in the Environmental Health Perspectives <a href="http://ehp03.niehs.nih.gov/article/fetchArticle.action?articleURI=info%3Adoi%2F10.1289%2Fehp.1103934" target="_blank">online version</a> on October 26, 2011. The CHEERS study was funded by the Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago.</p>
<p>The study’s objective was to “evaluate the incidence of illness, severity of illness, associations between water exposure and illness, and risk of illness attributable to limited-contact water recreation on waters dominated by wastewater effluent and on waters approved for general use recreation (such as swimming).” Dr. Dorevitch and his UIC collaborators, Preethi Pratap, Meredith Wroblewski, Daniel O. Hryhorczuk, Hong Li, Li C. Liu, and Peter A. Scheff, found that the recreational use of the Chicago River leads to similar incidence of gastrointestinal illness as the use of other local waterways. This was a surprise finding, according to Dr. Dorevitch, as he expected higher rates of sickness for people using the Chicago River which is primary a waste water effluent. However, people using the Chicago River had higher rates of eye symptoms than people using other local waterways. Another surprise finding, for Dr. Dorevitch, was that people using the Chicago River did not have higher rates of severe gastrointestinal illness requiring hospitalization than people using other local waterways.</p>
<p>For Dr. Dorevitch, the study findings raise questions about the safety of use of the Chicago River, but also questions about the water quality of the other local waterways, which are not primary waste water effluent, but have such high rates of illness for people who use them for recreational purposes.</p>

Each Fellow will receive a $10,000 award for the 2011-2012 academic year.</p>
<p>Kelly’s environmental engineering research interests center on identifying contamination sources and quantifying their contribution to specific sites with the goal of minimizing environmental contamination risk and supporting sustainable natural resource use. Her research advisor is Prof. Karl Rockne.</p>
<p>Basil’s research focuses on understanding the many ways that individual species, community composition, and ecosystem processes interact to influence one another and community change over time, particularly in the context of biological invasions and ecological restorations. His research advisor is Prof. David Wise.</p>
<p>Ryan, through his research, aims to show how fundamental safety issues (i.e. crime, responses to crime, and fear of crime) shape residents’ engagement with the built and natural environments, and thus influence their patterns of energy consumption. His research advisor is Prof. Nik Theodore.</p>
