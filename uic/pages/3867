<h3>Formal Methods in Concurrent and Distributed Systems</h3><p>

<P>
With the widespread use of distributed and concurrent systems and with
the increase in the complexity of software for such systems,
it becomes important to develop
various methods for ensuring the quality of concurrent software 
systems. This project proposes various methods for static 
as well as runtime verification of such computer systems.
</P>

<P>
As part of the static verification, the project investigates <b> model
checking </b> based methods for analysis and verification. It explores
such methods for deterministic as well as probabilistic systems.
</P>

<P>
As part of the run time verification, project develops methods for
detecting faults at execution time when the faults are specified on
the underlying computations of the system in  expressive languages
such as temporal logic and automata. The developed methods are used
for safe deployment and operation of Cyber Physical Systems such as
Autonomous cars, Home assist robots, etc. The project employs Hidden
Markov Models for capturing the behavior of such systems and develops
accurate and timely monitors for detecting erroneous behavior in such systems.
