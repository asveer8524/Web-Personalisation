        <h2 id="guidelines-procedures-governing-student-records">Guidelines and Procedures Governing Student Records</h2>

        <p id="purpose"><strong>I. PURPOSE</strong> </p>
        <p>The University of Illinois at
            Chicago maintains individual records and information about Students for
            the purpose of providing educational, vocational, and personal services
            to its Students. It is University policy to comply fully with federal statutes
            and regulations regarding the confidentiality of Student educational records.
            As required by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as
            amended, the following guidelines and procedures are intended to ensure
            the confidentiality of Student Education Records, to establish the right
            of Students to inspect and review their Education Records, to clarify the
            circumstances under which Educational Records may be released to third parties,
            and to establish the appropriate procedures to be followed by Students for
            the correction of inaccurate or misleading data within their Educational
            Records. Notice is given of rights and responsibilities of students under this policy in the Registration Agreement presented to students prior to online registration each semester.  Copies will also be available in the Office of the Vice Chancellor
            for Student Affairs and in the Office of Admissions and Records.</p>
        <p id="access-records"><strong>II. ACCESS TO RECORDS</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A. Student's Right to Inspect or Review Education Records</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Access and Review:</strong> UIC Students have the right to physically
                review their own Education Records in the presence of a designated University
                representative. Where necessary and reasonable, an explanation and interpretation
                of the record will be provided by qualified University personnel. Student
                access may include electronic means. To ensure that Students may only have
                access to their own records, a UIC Enterprise ID is assigned and stored in
                the University's Student Information System. This Enterprise ID and a password
                are required for access to the system.
                <ol class="lowerAlpha">
                    <li>The Student is required to submit
                        all requests for access to his/her records in writing to the appropriate office
                        and will be required to present appropriate identification.</li>
                    <li>The appropriate office shall comply
                        with the request within a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed 45 days
                        after receipt of the request.</li>
                    <li>Original records may not be removed
                        from any office where they are maintained.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Copies:</strong> Where circumstances effectively prevent
                the Student from exercising his/her right to inspect and review the record, the
                University will provide a copy of the records requested. Students may be required to pay a fee for
                copies of their records, including, but not limited to transcripts,
                certification of enrollment, certification of graduation, and enrollment
                letters. A Student may be denied a copy
                of his/her Student record (e.g., transcript, diploma, or certificate) in cases
                where an administrative hold has been placed on that Student's record. The Student may view such records,
                though will not be permitted to obtain a copy of said record until the hold has
                been properly removed.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>B. Limitations on Right to Inspect or Review</strong></p>
        <p>A Student may not inspect or review the following: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Financial records and information of his/her parent(s). </li>
            <li>Confidential
                letters or materials placed in records prior to January 1, 1975, as long as
                they are used only for the purposes for which they were written. </li>
            <li>Confidential
                letters or materials placed in records after January 1, 1975 if the Student has
                voluntarily submitted a written waiver, signed by the Student. Such letters and
                statements must be related to the Student's admission to the University,
                application for employment, or receipt of an honor or honorary recognition. If
                the Student has waived the right of inspection, the University will provide the
                Student, upon request, the names of the individuals who provided the letters
                and statements of recommendation. A waiver may be revoked with respect to any
                actions occurring after the revocation. A revocation must be made in writing.</li>
            <li>If an Education
                Record contains information about more than one Student, the Student may
                inspect and review or be informed of only the specific information about that
                Student. As such, that record may be
                censored (e.g. crossed-out or blanked-out) to protect information about the other
                Student(s). </li>
        </ol>
        <p id="identification-description-location-records"><strong>III. IDENTIFICATION, DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION OF RECORDS</strong></p>
        <p>A Student's Education Records are not maintained in one central location.
            Instead, various departments and units create and maintain <strong>files</strong> containing Education Records for Students. Although more than one department or unit may maintain a copy of a
            particular record, a Student should direct a request for that record to the
            appropriate department or unit who maintains the <strong>file</strong> housing
            that record. All University officials
            should refer a request promptly to the appropriate department(s). The following
            should guide the Student in directing his/her request. In addition, a glossary of commonly requested
            records with a listing of the location and custodian of those records is attached
            as <a href="records_policy_appendix_a.pdf" target="_blank">Appendix A</a> (pdf).</p>
        <p><strong>A. Academic Records</strong> </p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>The Office for Admissions and Records (OAR)</strong>
                <p>OAR maintains the official academic
                    record of a Student's cumulative history at UIC, including the Student's
                    admission, registration, and academic performance. The OAR file includes, but
                    is not limited to the Student's application for admission or readmission to the
                    University along with supporting documentation, transfer credit evaluation, and
                    other data pertinent to the evaluation of the Student's admissibility; the Student's
                    official transcript; certain demographic and biographic information; and petitions
                    for residency and supporting documentation. Please direct your request to the Director of the Office for Admissions
                    and Records. </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>The College/Unit/Department</strong>
                <p>The academic college, unit or
                    department in which the Student is enrolled maintains that Student's individual
                    academic records such as course materials, grade issuance/change materials,
                    advisor notes, communications, etc. For information concerning these records,

            <li>The disclosure is <strong>to comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena</strong>,
                including an IRS summons. The sufficiency of the order or subpoena will be
                determined by University Legal Counsel. The University will make a reasonable
                effort to notify the Student in advance of the existence of the order/subpoena
                and of its intent to comply, unless the disclosure is in compliance with; (i) A
                Federal grand jury subpoena and the court has ordered that the existence or the

The University will, except for the disclosure of directory information, inform the party to whom disclosure is made of the obligation to obtain the Student's consent before further disclosure to other parties. </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>C. Disclosure of Directory Information</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>General Policy:</strong> Directory Information pertaining to individual Students
                may be released at the discretion of the University. The definition of Directory
                Information will be provided in the University publication of course offerings
                and registration policies or other designated publications and is defined in
                section VII.D. below. All recipients of Student information within the
                University are required to comply with this policy. Directory information or
                lists of Student information will never be knowingly provided to any requesting
                party for commercial or political purposes unless required by law or legal
                process. If a Student directory is published, it will be equally available to
                all. </li>
            <li><strong>Opting Out of
                Disclosure:</strong> Each academic term,
                enrolled Students will be given the opportunity to notify the University in
                writing that they do not want their Directory Information disclosed without
                their prior written consent. Such requests must be submitted on the appropriate
                University form to the Office of Registration and Records no later than the
                tenth day of the semester (fifth day of Summer Session 2). Such requests for
                nondisclosure will be honored until the Student revokes the request in writing. </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>D. Recordkeeping of Disclosures</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>General Policy:</strong> The
                University shall maintain a record of each request for access to and each
                disclosure of personally identifiable information from the Education Records of
                each Student. The record of disclosure shall be maintained with the Education Record
                as long as the records are maintained. The record of disclosure shall include:
                <ol class="lowerAlpha">
                    <li>The parties who have
                        requested or received personally identifiable information; and, where relevant,</li>
                    <li>The legitimate educational
                        interests (see section IV.A.1. above) the parties had in requesting or
                        obtaining the information. </li>

            </li>
            <li> <strong>Exceptions:</strong> Records of disclosure are not required to be
                kept in the record of a Student under the following circumstances:
                <ol class="lowerAlpha">

        <p id="ammending-record"><strong> V. AMENDING AN EDUCATION RECORD</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A. Grounds:</strong> A Student has the right to request an amendment
            to his/her Education Record if he/she believes that it is inaccurate, misleading,
            or otherwise in violation of his/her privacy rights.</p>
        <p><strong>B. Procedure</strong></p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Request:</strong> To request an amendment to the Education
                Record, the Student shall, within sixty (60) days after inspecting and
                reviewing the record in question for the first time, file with the University
                office responsible for maintaining such records (See Section III. above), a
                written request for amendment stating the grounds for that amendment.

            </li>
            <li><strong>Review:</strong> Within thirty (30) days following
                receipt of such request, the unit head, or an authorized designee, shall review
                the record in question with the Student.</li>
            <li><strong>Response:</strong> The unit head/designee shall either
                amend the record as requested or notify the Student of the right to a hearing
                at which the Student and other persons directly involved in the establishment
                of the record will have an opportunity to present evidence to support or refute
                the contention that the subject record is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in
                violation of the Student's privacy or other rights. The right-to-hearing notice shall be sent to
                the Student via certified mail, return receipt requested, by messenger, or by
                some other means through which the date of receipt may be determined.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>C. Hearing</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Request for Hearing:</strong> If the Student wishes to exercise his/her
                right to the hearing, he/she shall, within ten (10) days following receipt of right-to-hearing
                notice, submit to the unit head a written request for a hearing. </li>
            <li><strong>Notice of Hearing:</strong> The Student will be
                given written notice sent to his/her last known address of the time and place
                of such hearing not less than ten (10) days in advance. </li>
            <li><strong>Hearing Attendees:</strong> The hearing will be conducted by a
                University representative who does not have a direct interest in the outcome.
                The Student shall have the right to attend the hearing; to be accompanied by
                one or more individuals of his/her choice at his/her own expense, including an
                attorney; to present evidence; and to call witnesses in his/her behalf. If the Student
                chooses to have an attorney present, he/she must notify the hearing officer no
                later than three (3) days prior to the hearing. The role of an attorney in the hearing process is limited to advising
                his/her client and, in no event, shall he/she have a speaking part in the
                proceedings.</li>
            <li><strong>Notice of Hearing Outcome: </strong>The Student shall be notified in writing of
                the decision within ten (10) days following the close of the hearing. Such
                decision is final. </li>
            <li><strong>Decision:</strong> The decision shall be based solely on the evidence
                presented at the hearing and shall include a summary of the evidence and
                reasons for the decision. If, as a result of the hearing, the Hearing Officer
                decides that the record is inaccurate, misleading or otherwise in violation of
                the privacy rights of the Student, he/she shall amend the record
                accordingly. If, on the other hand, the
                Hearing Officer determines that the record is not inaccurate, misleading or
                otherwise in violation of the Student's privacy rights, he/she will inform the Student
                of the right to place a statement in the record commenting on the contested
                information and/or stating why s/he disagrees with the decision of the University. That statement will be maintained with the
                contested part of the record for as long as the record is maintained and will
                be disclosed whenever the part of the record to which it relates is disclosed.</li>
            <li><strong>Exception:</strong> A hearing may not be requested by a Student to contest the
                assignment of a grade; however, a hearing may be requested to contest whether
                or not the assigned grade was recorded accurately in the Education Record of
                the Student. Note that according to UIC
                policy, changes/correction to final grades are permitted only up to two (2)
                years after recording the final grade in a student's academic record so long as
                the course instructor, department chair/head, and college office approve of the
                change/correction. No grade
                change/corrections are allowed after the two-year time limitation. Colleges, however, are permitted to adopt a
                more restrictive policy. As such,
                Students should check with their colleges concerning the time limit policy.</li>
        </ol>
        <p id="complaint"><strong>VI. RIGHT TO FILE COMPLAINTS</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A.</strong> If a Student believes that his/her
            rights have been violated, he/she should first file a complaint with the head
            of the unit which maintains the records in question. </p>
        <p><strong>B.</strong> If, after exhausting all internal
            remedies available within the University, the Student still contends that
            his/her rights have been violated, written complaints can be filed with: <em><strong>Family

        <p id="maintenance-disposal"><strong>VII. Maintenance/Destruction/Disposal of Records</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A.</strong> Persons in charge of Education Records

        <p><strong>B.</strong> The University may dispose of Education
            Records when they are no longer necessary, in accordance with applicable federal

            record shall not be destroyed until access has been granted or until a decision
            has been rendered.</p>

                providing the treatment, provided, however, that these records can be reviewed

        <p><em>[1] According to IRS Publication 501, a Student would be
            considered a "dependent" for purposes of
            claiming an exemption if he/she meets the following 5 criteria: (1) He/she either (a) lived with the
            taxpayer for the entire year as a member
            of the household, or (b) is related to the taxpayer in one of the ways listed
            in the regulations
            (e.g., child, grandchild, stepchild, etc.); (2) He/she
            is a U.S. citizen or resident, or a resident of Canada or Mexico, for some part
            of the calendar year in which the relevant tax year begins (there is an
            exception for certain adopted children); (3) He/she did not file a joint return with the taxpayer; (4) He/she had a gross income below that of
            the amount set by the IRS for the relevant calendar year (e.g. $3,100 for 2004)
            OR he/she is the child of the taxpayer and is either (a) under age 19 at the
            end of the year, or (b) a Student under age 24 at the end of the year.); and
            (5) The taxpayer provides
            more than half of the Student's total support during the calendar (there are
            special rules that apply in the following two situations: (a) two or more persons provide support, but
            no one person provides more than half of a person's total support; or (b) the
            person supported is the child of divorced or separated parents. ) See IRS Publication 501 for further
            information. </em></p>
