<p><b><span lang=EN style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:&quot;Lucida Sans&quot;;'>Overview</span></b></p>

<p>This course will introduce undergraduate students from a wide variety of
backgrounds to basic concepts of computer security and online privacy. The
course will follow a very practical approach for familiarizing students with
common security/privacy issues and widely deployed tools and technologies. The
topics covered will be from a wide variety of topics, including basic
fundamentals of encryption in the Web,  password management, spam and phishing,
social networks and privacy leakage. At the end of the course, students are
expected to have a better understanding of common security/privacy risks that
users face, to have improved their security posture in everyday activities and,
finally, to obtain an initial exposure to cybersecurity-related research.</p>

<p><b><span lang=EN style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:&quot;Lucida Sans&quot;;'>Religious Holidays</span></b></p> 
<p>Students who wish to observe their religious holidays shall notify the faculty member by the tenth day of the semester 
of the date when they will be absent unless the religious holiday is observed on or before the tenth day of the semester.  
In such cases, the student shall notify the faculty member at least five days in advance of the date when he/she will be absent.  
The faculty member shall make every reasonable effort to honor the request, not penalize the student for missing the class, and 
if an examination or project is due during the absence, give the student an exam or assignment equivalent to the one completed 
by those students in attendance.  If the student feels aggrieved, he/she may request remedy through 
the <a href="https://oae.uic.edu/docs/ReligiousHolidaysFY20152018.pdf">campus grievance procedure.</a></p>
