<h2><a id="a" name="a"></a>Academic Planning and Progress</h2>
<p>UIC entrusts its students with the responsibility of managing their academic planning and progress. The university expects students to follow the degree requirements and academic policies outlined in this publication. Students choose their degree programs, select and register for courses each term, and track their progress toward degree completion. In return, UIC provides students with a range of resources that are useful for academic planning, completing course requirements, and remaining on track for graduation. Many of these academic planning resources can be accessed online using the portal <em><a href="http://my.uic.edu" target="_blank">my.UIC</a></em>.</p>
<h3><a id="a1" name="a1"></a>Essential Online Resources for Students</h3>
<h4>Transferology</h4>
<p>Transferology works in conjunction with the university degree audit reporting system (DARS) to create transfer planning guides. Transferology planning guides assist prospective students by providing current information about how transfer credit is applied to specific UIC undergraduate degree programs. Students can create Transferology accounts at <a href="http://www.transferology.com" target="_blank">http://www.transferology.com</a>.</p>
<p>Current UIC students should contact their college advising office for information on transfer credit restrictions prior to enrolling in courses at other institutions.</p>
<h4>DARS Web</h4>
<p>The Degree Audit and Reporting System (DARS) produces a degree audit report intended for use within the university to facilitate advisement and to monitor progress toward undergraduate program completion. The DARS Report identifies all components of the student’s chosen degree program, indicates how requirements have been met, and provides lists of approved courses from which the student may choose to fulfill remaining requirements.</p>
<p>Students should review a DARS Report each semester through DARS Web for Student and consult with an advisor each semester to select courses for the following semester. DARS Web is accessed through the <a href="http://my.uic.edu" target="_blank"><em>my.UIC</em></a> portal on the Degree Audit tab.</p>
<h4>Online Catalog and Course Descriptions</h4>
<p>The <em>2017–2019 Undergraduate Catalog</em> is online at <a href="http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat" target="_blank">http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat</a> in html and archived formats. The html version is updated regularly as degree programs, courses, and requirements change. The archived version remains static as degree programs and requirements change.</p>
<p>Course descriptions are online at <a href="/ucat/course-descriptions/">http://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/course-descriptions</a>. The <em>Schedule of Classes</em>, a listing of courses for each term, can be accessed through <em><a href="http://my.uic.edu/" target="_blank">my.UIC</a>.</em></p>
<h3><a id="a2" name="a2"></a>Planning for Academic Success</h3>
<p>Planning for academic success begins early. To earn a degree from the University of Illinois at Chicago, students need to make thoughtful decisions about course selection each term; fulfill the degree requirements outlined by the university, college, and, if applicable, the department or school; and demonstrate competence in all courses according to university and college standards.</p>
<p>New students are often surprised by the transition to college academic life. For the first time, students are wholly responsible for their own success. Going to classes, doing the work, and understanding the concepts are up to the student. Selecting courses, meeting degree requirements, and following academic policies are the students’ responsibility. Asking questions, identifying problems, and seeking advice or help when necessary are a student’s prerogative. Students will find knowledgeable, caring faculty and advisors across campus ready to help with these and other concerns; all they have to do is ask.</p>
<p>Many first year students are undecided about a major. It is possible to be undecided and make progress toward a degree, but it requires careful planning with the help of an advisor. Similarly, a large number of students discover along the way that they would like to change majors. UIC offers a wide array of undergraduate degree programs to satisfy most academic interests. Students should discuss the options with an advisor before making a final decision. Advisors can help students identify degree programs of interest, entrance requirements, and degree requirements that have already been met.</p>
<p>Lots of students begin college with the goal of graduating in four years. To graduate in four years, students need to take at least 15 hours per semester. Whether or not a course load of 15 or more semester hours is manageable depends on several factors, including the difficulty of particular courses and degree programs, outside commitments like work and family, and individual learning styles. Academic advisors can help students set reasonable goals based upon individual circumstances. Before making the decision to extend graduation beyond four years, students should also meet with a financial aid counselor to discuss the impact of such a decision on the total cost of education and financial support.</p>
<p>Students should keep the following tips in mind as they plan for academic success:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Maintain files of relevant paper and electronic university correspondence, DARS Reports, academic planning worksheets, and other important documentation pertaining to enrollment at UIC.</li>
	<li>Meet with an advisor once a semester or more frequently as necessary.</li>
	<li>Attend instructors’ office hours to ask questions about lecture material, course readings, and assignments.</li>
	<li>Use the University Library system, including working with undergraduate librarians, to complete course requirements and build important research skills.</li>
	<li>Take advantage of tutoring.</li>
	<li>Go to every class.</li>
	<li>Be realistic about academic goals.</li>
	<li>Consider all the factors impacting a manageable course load as well as the four-year tuition guarantee and plan accordingly. For instance, plan on summer session courses if not taking a course load of 15 or more hours per semester.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="a3" name="a3"></a>Academic Advising</h3>
<h4>Academic Advising Mission Statement</h4>
<p>The mission of academic advising at the University of Illinois at Chicago is to ensure successful undergraduate educational experiences. Academic advising is centered in the colleges. The larger advising network assists students with making the transition to college life and guides their informed decisions about the academic priorities, progress, and goals integral to completing degrees and preparing for careers.</p>
<h4>Identifying the Advisor and Scheduling Appointments</h4>
<p>Academic advisors are professional staff and faculty members who assist students with course selection, scheduling, degree requirements, administrative requirements, the interpretation of rules and regulations, and the utilization of campus resources. Academic advising is available to all UIC students. Academic advising at UIC is decentralized, which means that it occurs in the major college or department. Students can learn more about academic advising at UIC by visiting the website <a href="http://advising.uic.edu" target="_blank">http://advising.uic.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Students should plan to meet with an academic advisor each term. The following guidelines are offered to help students make the most of advising appointments:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Schedule appointments well in advance of registration.</li>
	<li>Examine degree requirements, course descriptions, and the <em>Schedule of Classes</em> prior to the advising appointment.</li>
	<li>Develop a tentative schedule before meeting with an advisor.</li>
	<li>Ask for clarification on issues pertaining to scheduling, degree requirements, course selection, academic policies, or anything else that may impact academic progress.</li>
	<li>Review a DARS Report outlining progress toward the degree at each advising appointment.</li>
	<li>Keep track of progress toward the degree and review records with the advisor. Advisors assist students with this process, but it is the students’ responsibility to make sure that all degree requirements are met.</li>
	<li>Be aware of <em>Change of Course Schedule (Drop/Add)</em> rules and rules on <em>Withdrawal</em> from classes.</li>
	<li>Stay informed of rules governing <em><a href="/ucat/admissions-registration-finances/financial-aid/#sap">Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid</a></em>, which may be found in the <em>Financial Aid</em> section of the catalog. Do not drop courses or withdraw without considering these rules and consulting a financial aid advisor if receiving financial aid.</li>
	<li>Remember that advisors provide students with understanding and clarification of the options available, but students make their own decisions.</li>
	<li>Make the best possible decisions by consulting the catalog, a DARS Report, and an advisor prior to course selection, registration, and enrollment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students should consult their college section of the catalog for specific information on academic advising through the college or department.</p>

<h2><a id="d" name="d"></a>Summer Session Office</h2>

<a href="http://summer.uic.edu" target="_blank">http://summer.uic.edu</a></p>
<p>The UIC Summer Session Office works to provide both current UIC and visiting students with timely information about the UIC summer sessions. Enrolling in summer courses is a good way for students to catch up or get ahead in their academic studies or manage a heavy course load during the fall or spring. UIC offers students two summer sessions, Summer Session 1 (4-week session) followed by Summer Session 2 (8-week session). Students can enroll in courses in one or a combination of both. Although the summer sessions are shorter in length, all courses offered in the summer are worth the same number of credit hours as the same courses in the fall or spring. UIC students interested in taking advantage of summer session courses should discuss their plans with their college advisor.</p>
<h3><a id="d1" name="d1"></a>Continuing UIC Students and Summer Session</h3>
<p>Continuing UIC students register for summer in the same way as they do for fall or spring. In the spring, all eligible, continuing UIC students will be notified as to when they can view their Time Ticket online for summer and fall registration. The Time Ticket shows the earliest date and time that a student may register. As a general rule, undergraduate students may take up to 12 semester hours over the summer without special approval—either as a combination of courses taken in the 4-week and 8-week sessions, or just courses taken in the 8-week session.</p>
<h3><a id="d2" name="d2"></a>Visiting Students and Summer Session</h3>
<p>Visiting students who want to take undergraduate courses at UIC during the summer only and who do not intend to continue at UIC in the fall should apply using the Summer Session Only application. Please see the Summer Session website for further information on admission criteria and the application process. Summer Session Only students are admitted as nondegree students and are eligible to register for summer classes. Summer Session Only students may register online during Open Registration for summer, (check the Summer Session website for exact dates). As a general rule, Summer Session Only students may take up to 12 semester hours without special approval—either as a combination of courses taken in the 4-week and 8-week sessions, or just courses taken in the 8-week session.</p>
<p>Additional information about the UIC Summer Session can be found on the Summer Session website <a href="http://summer.uic.edu" target="_blank">http://summer.uic.edu</a> or by contacting the Summer Session Office at (312) 996-9099.</p>

<p>Full-time students who desire to earn, upon graduation, a commission as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force, should consider joining the Air Force ROTC program. Through a crosstown agreement with the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in Chicago, UIC students enroll in Air Force ROTC courses at the IIT main campus. The Department of Aerospace Studies is located on the 2nd floor of the Stuart Building, on the corner of 31st Street and State Street, in Chicago.</p>
<h4>Scholarship Opportunities</h4>
<p>Qualified applicants may compete for either full-tuition Illinois state scholarships or federal scholarships that pay full or partial tuition and fees, all textbook costs, and monthly subsistence allowance. Students should contact the Unit Admissions Officer to determine eligibilty for competitive or noncompetitive scholarships to help pay tuition while participating in Air Force ROTC.</p>
<h4>Attendance</h4>
<p>Students who join Air Force ROTC will hold the rank of “cadet.” During the fall and spring semesters, all cadets attend the leadership laboratory at IIT on Thursday afternoons. As a freshman or sophomore cadet, students will also attend Thursday afternoon AFROTC classes following leadership lab. Junior and senior cadets attend Air Force ROTC classes on Tuesday afternoons. All UIC cadets must attend 2 Physical Training (PT) sessions per week at UIC with their fellow cadets.</p>
<h4>Four-Year Program</h4>
<p>The four-year program consists of a four-semester General Military Course (GMC) and a four-semester Professional Officer Course (POC). Cadets normally start this program in their freshman year, but may start as sophomores by enrolling in the AS 100 and AS 200 courses. A student who is not on an AFROTC scholarship may withdraw from the GMC at any time. Students must complete an AFROTC paid four-week field training encampment at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, before being awarded POC status. This requirement is normally completed the summer between the sophomore year and junior year. The major areas of study during field training include junior officer training, career orientation, survival training, base functions, and the Air Force environment.</p>

Mr. Christopher Rosebrock, Enrollment Officer<br/>
MSG Jason Wenzel, Assistant Professor of Military Science</p>
<p>Army ROTC at UIC is specifically designed to give college students training and experience in the art of organizing, motivating, and leading others while completing their studies for a baccalaureate degree in an academic discipline of their own choice. Completion of the program leads to a commission in the U.S. Army. The Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) is open to all eligible full-time students, both male and female. A total of 32 semester hours of academic credit is available and is potentially applicable to graduation requirements as elective credit. The curriculum is centered on an applied leadership training program which is designed to develop personal traits and qualities essential to successful leadership in civilian life as well as the military environment.</p>
<p>ROTC basic courses are available to all students as an elective. Requirements for enrollment in the Advanced Course and to pursue a commission as an Army officer are as follows:</p>
<ol>
	<li>United States citizenship (legal residents may enroll in the Advanced Course, but must obtain citizenship prior to commissioning).</li>
	<li>Full-time student in good academic standing.</li>
	<li>Medically qualified for commissioning.</li>
	<li>Physically fit enough to pass the Army Physical Fitness Test and Water Survival Test.</li>
</ol>
<p>A student entering the university with successful completion of military training in high school at an accredited Junior ROTC program is entitled, upon enrollment, to higher placement as determined by the professor of military science. Instruction is offered through four-year and two-year programs. The four-year program consists of the Basic Course (first two years) and the Advanced Course (last two years). Cadets are issued, at no cost, uniforms and equipment necessary for the ROTC program.</p>
<h4>Basic Course</h4>
<p>The basic course, normally completed during the freshman and sophomore years, provides the student with a general knowledge of the military’s role in society and the missions of the Army. Subjects include leadership, land navigation, marksmanship, military history, and basic military skills. Students enroll in one military science course each semester. Additionally, a weekend field training exercise is required each semester. It is possible for a sophomore to complete the basic course in one year through prior arrangement with the department. The basic course consists of the first two years of Army ROTC classes including <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MILS%20101" title="MILS 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MILS 101');">MILS 101</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MILS%20102" title="MILS 102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MILS 102');">MILS 102</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MILS%20201" title="MILS 201" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MILS 201');">MILS 201</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MILS%20202" title="MILS 202" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MILS 202');">MILS 202</a></span>. Nonscholarship students who participate in or complete the basic program have no military service obligation.</p>

<h4>Advanced Course</h4>
<p>The advanced course is the professional phase of the ROTC program. Upon satisfactory completion of the required ROTC courses and the professional military education (PME) component, the student is eligible for a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the active Army, the Army National Guard, or the U.S. Army Reserve. The professional phase includes courses in leadership skills, training, personnel management, ethics, military justice, and military tactics. During the two years of the advanced course, students enroll in one military science course per semester.</p>
<h4>Leadership Laboratory</h4>
<p>Leadership laboratories are taught in conjunction with military science classes. The primary objective of leadership labs is to serve as a vehicle for leadership development. During leadership labs, MSIV and MSIII cadets perform respective supervisory roles as officers and noncommissioned officers (NCOs), while MSI and II cadets perform hands-on tasks that complement classroom instruction.</p>
<h4>Financial Assistance and Scholarships</h4>
<p>The ROTC Program offers financial assistance to qualified students in the form of tuition waivers, two-, three-, and four-year Army ROTC Scholarships, the Guaranteed Reserve Forces Scholarship, and the State of Illinois ROTC Scholarship Program. A $300 to $500 monthly stipend allowance is paid to all contracted cadets, depending upon their military science class.</p>

<p>Through the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) Program, young men and women prepare for rewarding careers as officers in the United States Navy or the United States Marine Corps. Graduates of the program have served as submarine and surface warfare officers, nuclear reactor design engineers, fighter pilots, special forces, and some have even gone on to be astronauts.</p>
<p>Scholarship program students are selected either by nationwide competition or from college program students (see below) recommended by the professor of naval science. For a period normally not exceeding four years, the Navy pays for all tuition, books, and fees, and provides an allowance of $250 to $400 per month. Graduates of the scholarship program receive a commission as Ensign, U.S. Navy, or Second Lieutenant, U.S. Marine Corps. Scholarship program students are presently required to serve a minimum of five years on active duty.</p>
<p>College Program students are nonscholarship students that participate in all school-year naval science classes and activities. They compete nationally for 2- and 3-year NROTC scholarships. For UIC students, ten Illinois State ROTC Scholarship tuition waivers are available for College Program students per each incoming class. If an NROTC scholarship is not earned by their junior year, students can apply to continue in the NROTC program with “advanced standing.” These selected students receive a monthly allowance of $350 as juniors and $400 as seniors. College Program graduates receive commissions as Ensign, U.S. Navy, or Second Lieutenant, U.S. Marine Corps.</p>
<p>During the summer months, students are assigned to naval ships and stations where their education as future naval officers is enhanced by on-the-job training. Scholarship NROTC students attend summer training each year; College Program students attend during the summer preceding their last academic year.</p>
<p>The naval science courses consist of both a lecture and laboratory period. The lecture and laboratory periods are held at the Illinois Institute of Technology. Lecture days will vary depending on the course. The laboratory period is held each Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>Students planning to enter the NROTC program in the fall semester are expected to attend a weeklong orientation program in August, designed to acquaint them with the program and with U.S. naval tradition. Students interested in attending this program should contact the NROTC office before July 1. For further information on NROTC, call the Department of Naval Science, (312) 567-3530 or visit the office at Illinois Institute of Technology, Room 215 Stuart Building, on the northwest corner of 31st and State Streets, Chicago, Illinois.</p>

<p>The Science Learning Center (SLC) is a place in which all levels of expertise meet and exchange ideas. The SLC is a great place to meet up with classmates, seek help from teaching assistants, or join a peer-led study group. Students can obtain help in many science courses from graduate teaching assistants who keep regular office hours each week. Students may also find their teacher in the center as many of them use the open, friendly spaces available in the center for their office hours.</p>
<p>The Science Learning Center is also home to peer-led study groups for many science courses. The peer-leaders are students who have recently excelled in a particular course and have been trained in helping others. Peer-leaders guide their students toward development of sound study skills by encouraging them to work together to solve problems. The goal of the peer-led study groups is to assist students to develop individual study strategies tailored to the demands of a specific discipline.</p>
<p>The goals of the center include both the here-and-now need for academic assistance as well as the vision of exposing students to the interdisciplinary nature of science. There are nine computers, two email stations, and several smaller spaces designed for personal computer use. The Science Learning Center is wireless and the space incorporates two computer classrooms (205B and 205C) as well. It is open Monday through Thursday from 8:00 a.m. until 6:30 p.m., and from 8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. on Friday.</p>

<p>Since its establishment by Illinois legislative mandate in 1978, the Urban Health Program has played a direct role in the graduation of more than 6,000 Black, Latino and Native American students from the health professions colleges at UIC. As a result of the Urban Health Program’s efforts, UIC recruits and graduates more healthcare professionals of traditionally underserved heritage than any other college or university in the country. Partnering with elementary schools, high schools, student support programs, and other colleges and universities across Illinois, UHP is one of the only programs of its kind.</p>
<h3><a id="h13" name="h13"></a>Writing Center</h3>
<p>105 Grant Hall (GH)<br/>
(312) 413-2206<br/>
<a href="http://writingcenter.uic.edu/" target="_blank">http://writingcenter.uic.edu</a></p>
<p>At the Writing Center, students work collaboratively with peer tutors on any writing—course assignments, labs, job applications, or personal statements. Students are encouraged to come early in the writing process so that they can make changes well before a deadline. Students are welcome to come with no writing at all and use the time to read over and discuss assignments or writing prompts.</p>
<p>Students can schedule their own appointments by using our online scheduler, which can found on our website: <a href="http://writingcenter.uic.edu" target="_blank">http://writingcenter.uic.edu</a>. Students can make up to two appointments per week and work. The Writing Center can be very busy towards the end of the semester, so students are encouraged to make their appointments in advance.</p>
<p>The Writing Center is open from the second week of the semester through Wednesday noon of finals week:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Mondays: 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.</li>
	<li>Tuesdays: 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.</li>
	<li>Wednesdays: 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.</li>
	<li>Thursdays: 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.</li>
	<li>Fridays: 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tutors at the Writing Center are students from all majors who have completed their required writing courses and have been trained as tutors in <a href="/search/?P=ENGL%20222">ENGL 222</a> or <a href="/search/?P=ENGL%20482">ENGL 482</a>. Students who are interested in becoming tutors are encouraged to find out about these tutor training and advanced writing courses.</p>
<p>Faculty and instructors are also welcome to use the Writing Center as a resource for workshops, course development, and collaboration with other faculty.</p>
<p>The UIC Writing Center strives to create a diverse community of learning, which operates in the spirit of mutual respect. Through education, research, and public service, the Writing Center complements the mission envisioned by the University of Illinois at Chicago.</p>
