<H2> Project description </h2>
<p>
A commercial Web page typically contains many information blocks. 
Apart from the main content blocks, it usually has such blocks as 
navigation panels, copyright and privacy notices, and advertisements 
(for business purposes and for easy user access). We call these blocks 
that are not the main content blocks of the page the noisy blocks. 
We show that the information contained in these noisy blocks can 
seriously harm Web data mining. Eliminating these noises is thus 
of great importance. In this research, we propose two noise elimination 
technique, which is based on the following observation: In a given 
Web site, noisy blocks usually share some common contents and 
presentation styles, while the main content blocks of the pages are 
often diverse in their actual contents and/or presentation styles. 
Based on this observation, we propose some techniques to eliminte 
Web page noises. Our techniques first detect differnt templates 
from a set of Web pages and then identify the main content blocks.
The proposed techniques have been evaluated with two data 
mining tasks, Web page clustering and classification. Experimental 
results show that our noise elimination techniques are able to improve 
the mining results significantly. The papers are as follows:
