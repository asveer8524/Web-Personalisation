  <h2 id="homework-4-dns-resolution">Homework 4: DNS resolution</h2>

<p>In this homework, we talk to the global domain name system to resolve domain names into IP addresses and reverse. 
Some good domain names to try, which you definitely will be tested on. Additional domains may be added if we find something interesting in the week.</p>

<ul>
  <li>nibbles.cs.uic.edu</li>
  <li>www.cs.uic.edu</li>
  <li>www.yahoo.com.tw</li>
  <li>128.30.76.78</li>
</ul>

<p>To get started, check out the hw4 template from</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">public/hw4</code></p>

<p>this code already does most of the DNS querying and parsing for you. Your responsibility is to modify the hw4 to work as follows:<br />
The file root-servers.txt contains a list of DNS root servers. Your application must use this file to find a working root server to use. You can assume it will always be called root-servers.txt, and exist in the current working directory. If a server does not respond, it must move on to the next server. The parameters and output of the program are illustrated below.</p>

<p>You are obviously not allowed to use gethostbyname or getaddrinfo for this homework, nor are you allowed to run any executables such as “host” or “nslookup” from inside your program.</p>

<h3 id="hints">Hints</h3>

<p>Relevant DNS records you need to check are A, NS, CNAME and PTR. You need to find out how to recursively follow these DNS records to get your answer. PTR records help with reverse lookups.</p>

<p>To time out on a recv() call (in case you get no answer), use setsockopt() with the SO_RECVTIMEO option: http://linux.die.net/man/7/socket<br />
Alternatively, you can use alarm(), and set up a handler for SIGALRM. “man alarm()” and “man signal” will help you set that up. Or try the newer sigitimer().</p>

<p>Either way, look for errno==EINTR (for alarm) or errno=EAGAIN (for timeout) when recv() returns -1 when using these techniques to see if you actually timed out. If you want to jump off the deep end of the pool, use a select() call (which takes a timeout parameter) instead of the blocking recv().<br />
You can try out the template version like this:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">./hw4 -d -n nameserver -i domain</code></p>

<p>to find your local DNS server, check your network settings, or run “<code class="highlighter-rouge">cat /etc/resolv.conf</code>” on a non-windows machine.</p>
