<h2>Adaptive Replication </h2>

The Internet and the World-Wide-Web are
rapidly moving us towards a distributed, wholly interconnected
information environment. In this environment
an object will be accessed, i.e. read and written,
from many locations that may be geographically distributed
world-wide.
In such an environment performance and cost will be of crucial
importance, and replication is an approach 
for addressing both issues.
For example, the Internet news is a gigabyte database highly
replicated service, and it responds to queries in seconds;
in contrast, many nonreplicated servers are much slower.
However, massive replication can become very expensive 
when a large number of database updates occur, since these are
usually propagated to many replicas.  Caching is often used 
to address this problem of replication being sometimes
advantageous
and sometimes detrimental.  Caching creates/deletes replicas
at a client, as need dictates. 
Caching is a particular case of our proposed concept of
adaptive replication.
<p>

Adaptive replication means that the number of copies of an
object, the location of these copies, and which updates are
propagated to each copy, change dynamically 
depending on a given cost function.

Caching is a particular case of adaptive replication in the
sense that it is usually analyzed in a client/server
architecture,
in a given consistency model, in order to improve performance at
a client.
Adaptive replication is a more 
general concept, that can be applied to richer architectures,
for multiple consistency models, and for optimizing different
cost functions.
The precise interpretation of adaptive replication depends on 
the objective cost function. For example, it can improve
performance in
a distributed system for one objective function, and
it can reduce access cost in a client-server system for another
function.
<p>

The project has three main objectives.
First, establish the fundamental principles 
of adaptive replication in distributed systems.
Second,  develop, implement and analyze a
system for adaptive replication of objects.
Ideally, by parameterizing the Adaptive Replication (AR)
system with various cost
functions, and availability and consistency requirements,
we will produce different adaptive replication algorithms.
In practice, we expect that deriving an algorithm for a 
particular environment will require
more than specifying parameters to the AR system,
but we will strive to minimize the specialized code.
The third objective of the project is to
build a simulation testbed in which the user defines the
network, selects a replication algorithm, selects a cost model,
and an access pattern at each computer. The system will 
enable comparison among the various  adaptive and static
algorithms.
