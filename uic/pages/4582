					<h2></h2>
<p>Often when we&#8217;re not sure what to do when looking for information, we use tried and true methods and tools that usually work! After all, we help students every day and encourage them to build their skills in these areas.</p>
<p>But what happens when those methods don&#8217;t get us what we need? Perhaps we need a new methodology to approaching a particularly complex problem. Maybe we should re-frame the question into a research problem? If you think so&#8230;</p>
<p>Did you ever think that you could take some of your own advice and&#8230;<strong><a href="http://library.uic.edu/home/services" target="_blank">ASK A LIBRARIAN</a></strong> at our own UIC Library! Librarians are masters at finding information, vetting the sources of information, and generally providing incisive, helpful advice about how to find what we need.</p>
<p><a href="https://advising.uic.edu/files/2015/08/Annie-at-the-Library.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-990 aligncenter" src="https://advising.uic.edu/files/2015/08/Annie-at-the-Library-300x225.jpg" alt="Annie at the Library" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://advising.uic.edu/files/2015/08/Annie-at-the-Library-300x225.jpg 300w, https://advising.uic.edu/files/2015/08/Annie-at-the-Library-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://advising.uic.edu/files/2015/08/Annie-at-the-Library-1000x750.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Our UIC librarians are not only helpful to our students but to us! Don&#8217;t forget &#8211; we received some great updates about what they can do for our students in their presentation <a href="https://advising.uic.edu/files/2015/08/AcademicAdvisingSummit1120141.pdf" target="_blank">&#8220;Connecting Students with Library Research Services&#8221;</a> from the Fall 2014 Advising Summit. But here&#8217;s a secret &#8211; they can also help us!</p>

<strong>2. FOR YOUR INFORMATION: OSSP news &#8211; new staff, a new website, new scholarship portal and more&#8230;</strong><br />
Hello UIC Advisors,</p>
<p>The Office of Special Scholarship Programs offers a welcome to fall 2015 to all advisors! We have new staff, a new website, a new scholarship portal and new procedures for you to keep up on scholarships and tell us about talented students.</p>
<p>Molly Hildebrand joined the office in late May and is the point person for the Guaranteed Professional Program Admission (GPPA) program as well as working with students applying for nationally competitive scholarships.<br />
Our new website launched last week and you can find us at <a href="http://ossp.uic.edu/" target="_blank">ossp.uic.edu</a><br />
UIC scholarships for continuing students are now centralized in one location in a program we’re calling UIC SnAP (Scholarship and Award Program). All enrolled students and any advisors currently enrolled in courses can access the scholarships at uic.academicworks.com. In the near future we hope to have descriptions accessible to all advisors, whether they are enrolled or not.</p>
<p>We continue to try to find ways to best serve students and we’re excited to tell you about Jumpstart: <a href="http://ossp.uic.edu/jumpstart/" target="_blank">http://ossp.uic.edu/jumpstart/</a> Encourage students to visit Jumpstart to explore how OSSP works and let students know that Jumpstart is how we start working with students who don’t have a specific scholarship in mind.</p>
<p>They will get a tour of the awards listed on the website</p>
<p>They will learn about signing up for our listserv, which is the best way to track internal and external scholarships with upcoming deadlines</p>
<p>They will learn about our library</p>
<p>They will have the opportunity to fill in an information form and these will be reviewed and responded to on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>They will learn about the scholarship advising services we offer</p>
<p>In collaborating with advisors on getting the right student to the right scholarship at the right time, we have two options for you.</p>
<p>If you’d like to get descriptions of major scholarships and their deadlines that you can send out to students, please email <a href="mailto:ssp@uic.edu">ssp@uic.edu</a> with a request to “add me to the advisor scholarship list”</p>
<p>If you come across students who knocks your socks off and you think that based on their grades, leadership, research, desire to or experience studying abroad, etc. they might be a good candidate for something, send an email to me or to Molly letting us know the students’ names, what you find so impressive about them, and their email addresses.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for all you do to help our students prepare for success in scholarship competitions and beyond. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Beth &amp; Molly</p>

<strong>3. FOR YOUR INFORMATION: Registration Requirements for International Students</strong><br />
August 21, 2015</p>
<p>From: Jim Hammerschmidt, PhD, Executive Director, Office of International Services<br />
Subject: Registration Requirements for International Students</p>
<p>With the arrival of Fall 2015 semester, the Office of International Services would like to provide the following reminders to all department administrators that may work with international students.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>All international students who are sponsored in F-1 or J-1 non-immigrant visa categories should be reminded of the following items in order to ensure they maintain their immigration status.</p>
<p>In order for international students to maintain their immigration status, they must be registered full time.</p>
<p>Full-Time Enrollment:</p>
<p>All undergraduate students who are enrolled at UIC and sponsored in F-1 or J-1 non-immigrant status must be registered for 12 credit hours to be considered full-time.</p>
<p>All graduate students who are enrolled at UIC and sponsored in F-1 or J-1 student status must be registered for at least nine credit hours to be considered a full-time student. Please see the Graduate College&#8217;s website for other policies regarding full-time status: <a href="http://grad.uic.edu/cms/?pid=1000035" target="_blank">http://grad.uic.edu/cms/?pid=1000035</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, information regarding immigration regulations on registration is also available at the OIS website at www.ois.uic.edu.</p>
<p>Graduate students who hold a 50% Graduate, Teaching or Research Assistantship at UIC are eligible to register for eight credit hours to be considered in status for immigration purposes, but would need to register for nine credit hours to be eligible for the CTA U-Pass Ventra Card (full-time status). Students with any other percentage assistantship appointments must register for nine credit hours to be considered in status and full-time. Students who have a GA, RA, or TA must submit the assistantship letter to OIS so their I-20/DS-2019 reflects their current funding.</p>
<p>All international graduate students who are awarded a fellowship or a Graduate College tuition and service-fee waiver (without an assistantship) must register for twelve credit hours.</p>
<p>ACADEMIC PREPARATORY COURSES</p>
<p>Only one online course (up to 3 credits) can count toward the full-time enrollment requirement. Preparatory courses with the prefix ASP carry no graduation credit and do not count towards establishing an international student as a full-time student for immigration purposes.</p>
<p>International students may take academic preparatory courses and additional online courses during the semester once their full course of study requirement is met.</p>
<p>PROGRAM EXTENSIONS</p>
<p>All international students must request a program extension of their I-20/DS-2019 if their document will be expiring before the end of this semester and they need additional time to complete their academic requirements. To learn the steps on how an international student can extend I-20/DS-2019, please visit the OIS website at: <a href="http://www.ois.uic.edu/students/current/extension/" target="_blank">http://www.ois.uic.edu/students/current/extension/</a>.</p>
<p>A program extension can only be requested prior to the end date on their document.</p>
<p>CHANGE OF MAJOR OR DEGREE LEVEL</p>
<p>Students wishing to change their major or degree level must notify OIS once it has been approved by the appropriate academic department and/or college. OIS will make the necessary updates to their I-20/DS-2019. For more information on how to update their document, visit the OIS web site: <a href="http://www.ois.uic.edu/students/current/academics/" target="_blank">http://www.ois.uic.edu/students/current/academics/</a></p>
<p>J-1 ON-CAMPUS EMPLOYMENT AUTHORIZATION NEEDED</p>
<p>J-1 students must obtain authorization from their program sponsor to engage in up to 20 hours per week of on-campus employment. Once authorized, UIC employment cannot exceed 20 hours per week while school is in session; this amount includes all other authorized employment. J-1 students may work more than 20 hours per week during official university breaks only (Winter Break, Summer).</p>
<p>J-1 students are required to report all on-campus employment to the Office of International Services (OIS) in 12 month increments. If you currently have J-1 students and working in your department, please remind them to consult with OIS to determine if authorization approval or renewal is needed.</p>
<p>Note: Graduate Assistantships correspond to a percentage of hours to be worked each week:</p>
<p>50% = 20 hours per week<br />
33% = 14-15 hours per week<br />
25% = 10 hours per week<br />
INTERNSHIPS AND CURRICULAR PRACTICAL TRAINING</p>
<p>All international students sponsored in either F-1 or J-1 non-immigrant visa status who are planning on any type of educational experience outside the classroom, whether it is paid or unpaid, must be sure to have the proper authorization before they begin. Visit the OIS website to learn more about applying for Curricular Practical Training<br />
(CPT) at <a href="http://www.ois.uic.edu/students/current/employment/" target="_blank">http://www.ois.uic.edu/students/current/employment/</a>.</p>
<p>F-2 DEPENDENT STUDY<br />
F-2 dependents of F-1 students in the United States may now study part-time in any certified program at an SEVP-certified school at the post-secondary level, as long as it does not amount to what regulations define as full-time study for an F-1. F-2 dependents can still participate full time in vocational or recreational studies, such as hobbies. F-2 minors must still comply with compulsory education requirements in attending kindergarten through 12th grade. However, an F-2 dependent who wants to enroll full time in a course of post-secondary academic or vocational study must apply for and obtain approval to change non-immigrant classification to F-1 before beginning their full-time study.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our office at ois@uic.edu or 312-996-3121.</p>

<strong>6. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT: SAVE THE DATE &#8211; Midwest First-Year Conference on 9/25/15</strong><br />
Educators committed to student success are continuously looking for ways to improve the college experience. What can we do to better engage students&#8217; curiosity and interest in learning? How can we make choices for academic programs and student services that increase students&#8217; chances for success? What factors matter most in planning for the success of new students?</p>
<p>The keynote speaker, Vincent Tinto, is a Distinguished University Professor Emeritus at Syracuse University and the former Chair of the Higher Education Program. He has carried out research and has written extensively on higher education, particularly on student success and the impact of learning communities on student growth and attainment. His book, Leaving College, published by the University of Chicago Press, lays out a theory and policy perspective on student success that is considered the benchmark by which work on these issues are judged. His most recent book, Completing College,also published by The University of Chicago Press, lays out a framework for institutional action for student success, describes the range of programs that have been effective in enhancing student success, and the types of policies institutions should follow to successfully implement programs in ways that endure and scale-up over time.</p>
<p>This regional one-day drive-in conference provides a forum for academic and student affair professionals to share ideas, resources, and engaging pedagogy to enhance their instruction of first-year students. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.mfyc.org" target="_blank">http://www.mfyc.org</a>. The conference will be held at Waubonsee Community College.</p>
<p>If you have questions about the upcoming drive-in conference on September 25, please contact Joy Sanders, Conference Planning Chair at 630-466-2938.</p>

					<p>Educators committed to student success are continuously looking for ways to improve the college experience. What can we do to better engage students&#8217; curiosity and interest in learning? How can we make choices for academic programs and student services that increase students&#8217; chances for success? What factors matter most in planning for the success of new students?</p>
<p>The keynote speaker, Vincent Tinto, is a Distinguished University Professor Emeritus at Syracuse University and the former Chair of the Higher Education Program. He has carried out research and has written extensively on higher education, particularly on student success and the impact of learning communities on student growth and attainment. His book, Leaving College, published by the University of Chicago Press, lays out a theory and policy perspective on student success that is considered the benchmark by which work on these issues are judged. His most recent book, Completing College,also published by The University of Chicago Press, lays out a framework for institutional action for student success, describes the range of programs that have been effective in enhancing student success, and the types of policies institutions should follow to successfully implement programs in ways that endure and scale-up over time.</p>
<p>This regional one-day drive-in conference provides a forum for academic and student affair professionals to share ideas, resources, and engaging pedagogy to enhance their instruction of first-year students. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.mfyc.org">http://www.mfyc.org</a>. The conference will be held at Waubonsee Community College.</p>
<p>If you have questions about the upcoming drive-in conference on September 25, please contact Joy Sanders, Conference Planning Chair at 630-466-2938.</p>

					<p><strong>August 21, 2015</strong></p>
<p><strong>From:  Jim Hammerschmidt, PhD, Executive Director, Office of International Services</strong><br />
<strong> Subject:  Registration Requirements for International Students</strong></p>
<p>With the arrival of Fall 2015 semester, the Office of International Services would like to provide the following reminders to all department administrators that may work with international students.<br />
<strong><br />
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS </strong></p>
<p>All international students who are sponsored in F-1 or J-1 non-immigrant visa categories should be reminded of the following items in order to ensure they maintain their immigration status.</p>
<p>In order for international students to maintain their immigration status, they must be registered full time.</p>
<p><strong>Full-Time Enrollment:</strong></p>
<p>All undergraduate students who are enrolled at UIC and sponsored in F-1 or J-1 non-immigrant status must be registered for 12 credit hours to be considered full-time.</p>
<p>All graduate students who are enrolled at UIC and sponsored in F-1 or J-1 student status must be registered for at least nine credit hours to be considered a full-time student. Please see the Graduate College&#8217;s website for other policies regarding full-time status: <a href="http://grad.uic.edu/cms/?pid=1000035">http://grad.uic.edu/cms/?pid=1000035</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, information regarding immigration regulations on registration is also available at the OIS website at <a href="http://www.ois.uic.edu">www.ois.uic.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Graduate students who hold a 50% Graduate, Teaching or Research Assistantship at UIC are eligible to register for eight credit hours to be considered in status for immigration purposes, but would need to register for nine credit hours to be eligible for the CTA U-Pass Ventra Card (full-time status). Students with any other percentage assistantship appointments must register for nine credit hours to be considered in status and full-time.  Students who have a GA, RA, or TA must submit the assistantship letter to OIS so their I-20/DS-2019 reflects their current funding.</p>
<p>All international graduate students who are awarded a fellowship or a Graduate College tuition and service-fee waiver (without an assistantship) must register for twelve credit hours.</p>
<p><strong>ACADEMIC PREPARATORY COURSES</strong></p>
<p>Only one online course (up to 3 credits) can count toward the full-time enrollment requirement. Preparatory courses with the prefix ASP carry no graduation credit and do not count towards establishing an international student as a full-time student for immigration purposes.</p>
<p>International students may take academic preparatory courses and additional online courses during the semester once their full course of study requirement is met.</p>
<p><strong>PROGRAM EXTENSIONS </strong></p>
<p>All international students must request a program extension of their I-20/DS-2019 if their document will be expiring before the end of this semester and they need additional time to complete their academic requirements. To learn the steps on how an international student can extend I-20/DS-2019, please visit the OIS website at: <a href="http://www.ois.uic.edu/students/current/extension/">http://www.ois.uic.edu/students/current/extension/</a>.</p>
<p>A program extension can only be requested prior to the end date on their document.</p>
<p><strong>CHANGE OF MAJOR OR DEGREE LEVEL</strong></p>
<p>Students wishing to change their major or degree level must notify OIS once it has been approved by the appropriate academic department and/or college.  OIS will make the necessary updates to their I-20/DS-2019. For more information on how to update their document, visit the OIS web site: <a href="http://www.ois.uic.edu/students/current/academics/">http://www.ois.uic.edu/students/current/academics/</a></p>
<p><strong>J-1 ON-CAMPUS EMPLOYMENT AUTHORIZATION NEEDED</strong></p>
<p>J-1 students must obtain authorization from their program sponsor to engage in up to 20 hours per week of on-campus employment. Once authorized, UIC employment cannot exceed 20 hours per week while school is in session; <u>this amount includes all other authorized employment</u>. J-1 students may work more than 20 hours per week during official university breaks only (Winter Break, Summer).</p>
<p>J-1 students are required to report all on-campus employment to the Office of International Services (OIS) in 12 month increments. If you currently have J-1 students and working in your department, please remind them to consult with OIS to determine if authorization approval or renewal is needed.</p>
<p>Note: Graduate Assistantships correspond to a percentage of hours to be worked each week:</p>
<ul>
<li>50% = 20 hours per week</li>
<li>33% = 14-15 hours per week</li>
<li>25% = 10 hours per week</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>INTERNSHIPS AND CURRICULAR PRACTICAL TRAINING </strong></p>
<p>All international students sponsored in either F-1 or J-1 non-immigrant visa status who are planning on any type of educational experience outside the classroom, whether it is paid or unpaid, must be sure to have the proper authorization before they begin. Visit the OIS website to learn more about applying for Curricular Practical Training<br />
(CPT) at <a href="http://www.ois.uic.edu/students/current/employment/">http://www.ois.uic.edu/students/current/employment/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>F-2 DEPENDENT STUDY</strong><br />
F-2 dependents of F-1 students in the United States may now study part-time in any certified program at an SEVP-certified school at the post-secondary level, as long as it does not amount to what regulations define as full-time study for an F-1. F-2 dependents can still participate full time in vocational or recreational studies, such as hobbies. F-2 minors must still comply with compulsory education requirements in attending kindergarten through 12th grade. However, an F-2 dependent who wants to enroll full time in a course of post-secondary academic or vocational study must apply for and obtain approval to change non-immigrant classification to F-1 before beginning their full-time study.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our office at <a href="mailto:ois@uic.edu">ois@uic.edu</a> or 312-996-3121.</p>

					<p>Hello UIC Advisors,</p>
<p>The Office of Special Scholarship Programs offers a welcome to fall 2015 to all advisors! We have new staff, a new website, a new scholarship portal and new procedures for you to keep up on scholarships and tell us about talented students.</p>
<ol>
<li>Molly Hildebrand joined the office in late May and is the point person for the Guaranteed Professional Program Admission (GPPA) program as well as working with students applying for nationally competitive scholarships.</li>
<li>Our new website launched last week and you can find us at <u><a href="ossp.uic.edu">uic.edu</a> </u></li>
<li>UIC scholarships for continuing students are now centralized in one location in a program we’re calling UIC SnAP (Scholarship and Award Program). All enrolled students and any advisors currently enrolled in courses can access the scholarships at <a href="http://www.uic.academicworks.com">uic.academicworks.com</a>. In the near future we hope to have descriptions accessible to all advisors, whether they are enrolled or not.</li>
<li>We continue to try to find ways to best serve students and we’re excited to tell you about Jumpstart:  <a href="http://ossp.uic.edu/jumpstart/">http://ossp.uic.edu/jumpstart/</a>  Encourage students to visit Jumpstart to explore how OSSP works and let students know that Jumpstart is how we start working with students who don’t have a specific scholarship in mind.
<ol>
<li>They will get a tour of the awards listed on the website</li>
<li>They will learn about signing up for our listserv, which is the best way to track internal and external scholarships with upcoming deadlines</li>
<li>They will learn about our library</li>
<li>They will have the opportunity to fill in an information form and these will be reviewed and responded to on a weekly basis.</li>
<li>They will learn about the scholarship advising services we offer</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In collaborating with advisors on getting the right student to the right scholarship at the right time, we have two options for you.
<ol>
<li>If you’d like to get descriptions of major scholarships and their deadlines that you can send out to students, please email <a href="mailto:ssp@uic.edu">ssp@uic.edu</a> with a request to “add me to the advisor scholarship list”</li>
<li>If you come across students who knocks your socks off and you think that based on their grades, leadership, research, desire to or experience studying abroad, etc. they might be a good candidate for something, send an email to me or to Molly letting us know the students’ names, what you find so impressive about them, and their email addresses.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks so much for all you do to help our students prepare for success in scholarship competitions and beyond. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Beth &amp; Molly</p>
