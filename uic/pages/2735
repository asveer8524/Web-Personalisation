<p>Sentiment analysis and opinion mining is the field of study that
analyzes people's opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, and
emotions from written language. It is one of the most active research
areas in natural language processing and is also widely studied in
data mining, Web mining, and text mining. In fact, this research has
spread outside of computer science to the management sciences and
social sciences due to its importance to business and society as a
whole. The growing importance of sentiment analysis coincides with
the growth of social media such as reviews, forum discussions, blogs,
micro-blogs, Twitter, and social networks. For the first time in
human history, we now have a huge volume of opinionated data
recorded in digital form for analysis.
<p>Sentiment analysis systems are being applied in almost every
business and social domain because opinions are central to almost all
human activities and are key influencers of our behaviors. Our beliefs
and perceptions of reality, and the choices we make, are largely
conditioned on how others see and evaluate the world. For this
reason, when we need to make a decision we often seek out the
opinions of others. This is true not only for individuals but also for
organizations.

<p> <b>Teaching and Learning</b>: 
This book is a comprehensive introductory and survey text. It covers
all important topics and the latest developments in the field with
over 400 references. It is suitable for students, researchers and
practitioners who are interested in social media analysis in general
and sentiment analysis in particular. Lecturers can readily use it in
class for courses on natural language processing, social media
analysis, text mining, and data mining.
