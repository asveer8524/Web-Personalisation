Welcome to the Computational Intelligence Laboratory (CIL) in
the <a href="http://www.ece.uic.edu">
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at the
<a href="http://www.uic.edu/">University of Illinois</a>
near downtown Chicago, Illinois.
This laboratory was established in August 1999.
The purpose of setting up such a laboratory
is to provide a lab that supports a research program which strives to bring
together the results of academic research in
the field of computational intelligence and the problems encountered in
engineering practice.
<!--We currently have  a

<h3><p>
The mission of CIL is to develop
methods, tools, and technology
for the design and implementation of learning systems which mimic
the learning process of humans, and apply them to real world problems.
The goal is to solve complex engineering problems
which are difficult to deal with using conventional approaches.
Current application areas include traffic control/management in telecommunication networks
    and learning control methodologies for automotive engines,
 among others.
The emphasis in CIL is on collaboration with
researchers and practitioners from academia and industry.

Some of the current projects in the laboratory are: </h3> <p>


<!--h3>Traffic
        Modeling and Performance Analysis<br> </h3>
        <ul> The huge amount of information, such as
    voice,
    video
    and Internet data,
    constitutes today's traffic
    flow in communication
    networks. All these traffic,
    whether packed in fixed-size or variable-size units of information,
    will be forwarded through telecommunication links,
    switches and other components of the network.
        The knowledge of the characteristics
        of the traffic flowing in the network plays one of the most
        important roles in the network design.
    It enables us to simulate, analyze, and
    predict the behavior of the
        network under various conditions
    so that the network performance can be optimized.
        The objective of our work is to develop traffic models
    which provide accurate characterization of traffic
    sources in wireless and wireline networks,
    require low computational complexity, and
    are useful for the performance analysis of communication
    networks.<p>

<!--h3><li>Video Processing and Compression<br> </h3>
        <ul> Video images are composed of frames of still images.
    HDTV and/or 3DTV will be commercialized in the future due to consumers'
    natural demand for high-quality images and viewing pleasures. Both
    HDTV and 3DTV signals need high ratio
    compression for pictures before transmission so that the signals can
    be transmitted through the existing
    broadcasting bandwidth (about 6MHz).  One possible implementation of
    HDTV system is to deliver the  HDTV signal and a regular digital TV
    signal through  one 6MHz channel.  The two signals together constitute
    the left and right images needed for 3DTV.
    The audience will have a choice to view HDTV program or
    3DTV-HDTV scene. The objective of this project is to develop an
    MPEG-2 compatible video coding scheme which will help  commercialized
    HDTV and 3DTV. </ul-->

<!--h3><li>Artificial Neural Networks<br> </h3>
        <ul> Neural networks are highly interconnected systems
        of simple processors (neurons) which manipulate data
        in a parallel manner. They are believed to be robust with respect
        to malfunctions of individual devices.
        Our applications are concerned with data mining, signal processing,
    telecommunications,
        pattern recognition, and controls.<p>

<h3>Computational Intelligence<br></h3>
<ul><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_intelligence>Click here</a>
<br>Computational intelligence combines elements of learning, adaptation, evolution and
fuzzy logic (rough sets) to create systemss that are, in some sense, intelligent.
Our research covers neural
networks, fuzzy systems and evolutionary computation, including swarm intelligence,
as well as their applications.</ul>

<br>
<br> Our current interest in this field is
    neural network-based approaches for intelligent systems and learning control.
    In particular, our study is focused on neural network-based
    adaptive critic designs. Adaptive critic designs are designs
    that approximate dynamic
       programming in the general case, i.e., approximate optimal control
    over time in noisy, nonlinear environments. There are many practical
       problems that can be formulated as to minimize or maximize
    a measure of cost.
    It is well-known that dynamic programming is very useful in
    solving these problems.
       However, it is often computationally untenable to run true dynamic
    programming due to the backward numerical process required for its
       solutions, i.e., due to the "curse of dimensionality."
    Over the years, progress has been made to circumvent the
    "curse of dimensionality" by
       building a system, called "critic" to approximate the cost
    function in dynamic programming. The idea is to approximate dynamic
       programming solutions by using a function approximation structure
    such as neural networks to approximate the cost function.
    Our work includes methodology
    development and applications of adaptive
       critic designs to automotive engine control.<p>

<!--b><h3>Management and Control of Wireless Networks<br> </h3></b>
        <ul> One of our current funded research effort is to study
management and control problems in wireless networks.
Our focus in this study is the call admission control in these networks.
Call admission control schemes are critical to the success of future
generations of wireless networks. On one hand, call admission
control schemes provide the users (mobile or non-mobile)
with access to a network
for services. On the other hand, they are the decision making part of
the network carriers with the objectives of providing services to users
with guaranteed quality and at the same time, achieving as high as possible
resource utilization
(to the network carriers, higher
resource utilization simply means higher revenue).
The goal of our work is to
develop and implement new and improved call admission
control schemes for wireless
    communication networks.<p>

<!--b><h3>Multiuser Detection in CDMA Systems<br> </h3></b>
        <ul>In CDMA wireless systems, the major impediments for signal detection
are multipath fading due to multiple replicas of the transmitted
signal arriving at the receiver with different phase
and multiple access interference
caused by cochannel users which are not orthogonal to the
desired users. Techniques used in combating these impediments include
rake matched filtering, multiuser detection, and antenna array processing.
Multiuser detection techniques reduce the effects of multiple
access interference by exploiting the underlying structure
induced by the spreading waveforms of the DS-CDMA user signals.
Our goal in this part of research is to obtain adaptive algorithms
that converge fast for
multiuser detection in CDMA wireless systems. It has been noted
by many researchers that the convergence speed of many proposed algorithms
are not fast enough for practical applications.
