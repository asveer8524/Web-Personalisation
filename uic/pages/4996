<hr />
<p><strong><em>Now that you know a bit about some of the events we&#8217;re planning, we need your opinion about a new idea:</em></strong></p>
<p>For Advisor Week this year, we wanted to try something different and look at a fun way to explore the city. The committee is exploring an Urban Adventure Quest (<a href="http://www.urbanadventurequest.com/how-it-works/default.aspx)">http://www.urbanadventurequest.com/how-it-works/default.aspx)</a>. This scavenger hunt/quiz/walking tour of downtown would allow teams of 3-5 people to compete against each other. Because we would need to purchase quests per team, we would need to know how many people would be interested in participating. Please let us know your interest at through the link below:</p>

Our final day of activities begins at 10:00 a.m. with a special presentation by a panel of advisors and faculty who will bring their expertise in working with students on scholarship advising. Many of us have students with whom we work on scholarship applications and Beth Powers has organized an opportunity for advisors to leverage the knowledge within our community to help us collaborate better to help students be the best possible scholarship applicants.</em></p>
<p><em>You will have an hour break to catch your breath before a lively discussion at 12:00 p.m. with the Thursday Topics Common Reading Group where participants will be discussing technology and advising millennial students. UARC is pleased to be providing lunch so you will have the stamina to consider these questions in a discussion format led by Viviana Kabbabe-Thompson.</em></p>
<p><em>Finally for tomorrow, to cap off our activities, it’s time to relax and enjoy a creative enterprise – painting! Do you want to try your hand at becoming UIC’s next great artist…or at the very least bringing home something new for your home or office? I can tell you from personal experience that Andrea Reyes from Scamp Studios is a joy to learn from and it’s a really fun activity to do with colleagues and friends. Join us after work, and for your trouble you can bring home a painting! We will enjoy some sweet refreshments and creative fun! I challenge even those who think they can’t paint, I surprised myself last year and had a ball doing it!</em></p>

Tomorrow’s morning is free but we will be hosting another Brown Bag Event starting at 12:00 p.m. and we have exciting news for you – it’s not a brown bag lunch and we are able to provide lunch for you if you can make it! The discussion is a follow-up to the NACADA Webinar from early March where three different universities presented on what they do for students on probation. I hope you can join us for a lively discussion including the thoughts and questions we have based upon NACADA’s webinar.</em></p>
<p><em>Later in the afternoon at 3:30 p.m., we are very excited to be hosting award-winning farmer Jessica Rinks of Purple Leaf Farms who will be doing seed planting with us. If you have a black thumb, following the easy steps that Jessica shows us will hopefully turn that black thumb green! For those of us who already have green thumbs, use this opportunity to begin your garden! At the end you will take home your started seeds but hopefully your and their first stop will be for nice, tasty Mexican munchies and beverages.</em></p>
<p><em>Meet up after work at 5:00 to relax and network at Lalo’s Mexican Restaurant on Maxwell Street. It’s a short walk to South Campus for a south of the border treat! UARC will be treating you to some great snacks, and Florencio, Nick and I are pleased to sponsor other refreshments. I am looking forward to the chance to catch up with many of you and meet new members of our community!</em></p>
