<b>Abstract</b>: 
Sentiment analysis is the computational study of peopleâ€™s opinions, sentiments, emotions,
and attitudes. This fascinating problem is increasingly important in business and
society. It offers numerous research challenges but promises insight useful to anyone
interested in opinion analysis and social media analysis.
This book gives a comprehensive introduction to the topic from a primarily natural
language processing point of view to help readers understand the underlying structure
of the problem and the language constructs that are commonly used to express opinions
and sentiments. It covers all core areas of sentiment analysis; includes many emerging
themes, such as debate analysis, intention mining, and fake-opinion detection; and
presents computational methods to analyze and summarize opinions. It will be a
valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in natural language processing,
computer science, management sciences, and the social sciences.

<p> <b>Teaching and Learning</b>: 
This book is suitable for students, researchers, and practitioners 
interested in natural language processing in general, and sentiment analysis, opinion mining, emotion analysis, debate analysis, and intention mining in specific. Lecturers can use the book in class.
