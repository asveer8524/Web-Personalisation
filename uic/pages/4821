<h2><a id="appointmenttypes"></a>A.    General Appointment Types/Principles</h2>
<p>The types/terms of appointments can vary according to a number of factors, including duration of appointment, permanent or temporary, etc.  The most commonly used types of appointment are defined as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><u>Academic Year Appointments</u>: Shall consist of two semesters for a total of nine months with service required for the period August 16 through May 15 (with no allowable vacation).  They are always paid over a twelve-month basis with exceptions for the following:</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;padding-left: 5em">a). Initial-partial term appointment.  An employee may request irrevocable approval for acknowledgement of financial hardship.  If approved, the employee may receive compensation during the initial-partial academic year only, paid over the period of service rather than a twelve-month period.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;padding-left: 5em">b). Final term appointment.  An employee who is retiring in the coming academic year may choose to receive their final salary paid over the period of service rather than over a twelve-month period; however, this irrevocable election for period of payment must be made prior to the payroll calculation for the first monthly payment in the final year of service.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;padding-left: 5em">c). Temporary/visiting appointments are paid over a nine-month period or on a pro-rata basis for shorter periods.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><u>Annual Appointments</u>: These are twelve-month appointments. Staff members on annual appointment perform academic duties for eleven months and receive one month of paid vacation</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><u>Ten-Month Appointments</u>: These require ten months of service paid over twelve months with no allowable vacation.  They are generally available to academic professional employees, but under certain circumstances, can be applied to a non-tenured faculty position.  Typical service dates are from two weeks prior to the academic year to two weeks following the academic year.  Dates of <u>no service</u> may vary so a written statement (offer letter) specifying the service period must be signed by the unit head and employee.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li><u>Summer Appointments</u>: Faculty employed on a nine-month or ten-month appointment may receive additional appointments not to exceed two months for nine-month and one month for ten-month appointments. Summer appointments for nine-month employees occur during any two-month period from May 16 through August 15.  For ten-month employees, the “summer appointment” period may vary depending on the period of non-service e.g., non-service may be during the months of December and January, resulting in a “summer appointment” during the month of January.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a id="tenureandtrackappointments"></a>B.     <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://oaadocs.uic.edu/106-TenuredTTAppointment.pdf" target="_blank">Tenure/Tenure-Track Faculty/Appointments</a></span></h2>
<p>The American Association of University Professors defines tenure as “a means to certain ends; specifically: (1) freedom of teaching and research and of extramural activities, and (2) a sufficient degree of economic security to make the profession attractive to men and women of ability. Freedom and economic security, hence, tenure, are indispensable to the success of an institution in fulfilling its obligations to its students and to society”.</p>
<p>The University of Illinois <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.bot.uillinois.edu/statutes" target="_blank"><strong><em>Statutes</em></strong></a></span>, Article II, Section 3 (a.1.) defines the faculty of the University and any of its units except for the Graduate College as “those members of the academic staff with the rank or title in that unit of professor, associate professor or assistant professor who are tenured or receiving probationary credit toward tenure, and those administrators in the direct line of responsibility for academic affairs (persons who hold the title director or dean in an academic unit, provost, chancellor and president).”</p>
<p>“As the responsible body in the teaching, research, and scholarly activities of the University, the faculty has the inherent interests and rights in academic policy and governance.  Each college or other academic unit shall be governed in its internal administration by its faculty, as defined above.  Governance of each academic unit shall be based on unit bylaws established and amended by the faculty of that unit.  The bylaws shall provide for the administrative organization and procedure of the unit, including the composition and tenure of executive or advisory committees.”</p>
<p>These bylaws may not conflict with the University of Illinois <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><em><a href="http://www.bot.uillinois.edu/statutes" target="_blank">Statutes</a></em></strong></span>, or other actions by the Board of Trustees.</p>
<h3>1.     <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://oaadocs.uic.edu/106-TenuredTTAppointment.pdf" target="_blank">Assistant Professor</a></span></h3>
<p>An appointee receiving his/her first contract as an assistant professor enters a probationary period of seven academic years of service. Prior academic service at other academic equivalent institutions <em>may</em> be credited, normally up to a maximum of three years, toward the fulfillment of the probationary period.</p>
<p>An initial appointment that begins after the eighth week of the academic year ordinarily does not count toward the probationary period of a faculty member on definite tenure nor does it ordinarily count as service in establishing eligibility for a sabbatical leave with pay, unless recommended and agreed upon in advance.</p>
<p>The rule of thumb is that the year will count if the appointment begins before the opening of the ninth week of the semester. If unusual circumstances apply in the case of an appointee who begins after August 16 but before the ninth week, the unit executive officer may appeal on behalf of the faculty member, through the appropriate administrative chain, for a delay in the start of the tenure clock until the next August 16. The provost will make the final decision in such cases. The appointee&#8217;s choice, if approved, cannot be reversed thereafter.</p>
<p>It is important for faculty members to understand the implications of counting or not counting years in which they provide less than a full year&#8217;s service toward completion of the probationary period, since that will affect the timing of promotion and tenure decisions. This also applies to initial appointments with respect to the question of prior service credit. In each instance, the department is responsible for assisting faculty members to understand fully the implications of their requests.</p>
<h3>2.      <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://oaadocs.uic.edu/106-TenuredTTAppointment.pdf" target="_blank">Associate Professor</a></span></h3>
<p>The rank of associate professor normally entails indefinite tenure and both rank and tenure are generally awarded during a review of promotion and tenure.  It is possible, with appropriate justification and prior approval by the unit, college,  provost,vice chancellor for health affairs (when applicable), and endorsement by the dean of the Graduate College, and the co-chair of the Campus Promotion and Tenure Committee, to request indefinite tenure at the rank of associate professor for an initial hire.</p>
<p>Tenure implies reciprocal responsibilities on the part of the University and the faculty member.  To that end the University provides academic freedom and the faculty members are obligated to provide and maintain high standards of teaching, research, professional service, and the communication of information and knowledge to others.</p>
<h3>3.      <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://oaadocs.uic.edu/106-TenuredTTAppointment.pdf" target="_blank">Professor</a></span></h3>
<p>The rank of professor is associated with indefinite tenure and both rank and tenure are generally awarded during a review of promotion and tenure.  It is possible, with appropriate justification and prior approval by the unit, college, provost, vice chancellor for health affairs (when applicable), and endorsement by the dean of the Graduate College, and the co-chair of the Campus Promotion and Tenure Committee, to request indefinite tenure at the rank of professor for an initial hire.</p>

<h3>4.      <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://oaadocs.uic.edu/108-QAppointment.pdf" target="_blank">Initial Term (“Q”) Appointment for New Associate and Full Professor</a></span></h3>
<p>“Q” appointments are appropriate to consider when a unit recruiting a person from outside the University finds that the candidate does not yet possess the record of particular achievement expected of a tenured member on this campus, even though the person is of relatively senior standing in the field.  The “Q” status involves appointments at either an associate professor or full professor level with an initial probationary period before review for indefinite tenure.</p>
<p>The authority for the “Q” appointment status is found in the University of Illinois <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.bot.uillinois.edu/statutes" target="_blank"><strong><em>Statutes</em></strong></a></span>.  Article X, Section 1a(1) provides that “an appointment as professor or associate professor shall be for an indefinite term except that first appointments or temporary appointments may be for shorter periods.”</p>
<p>UIC policy allows the hire of a new associate or full professor, non-tenured, on an initial term, or “Q” appointment, for as long as four years.  During the final year of the “Q” appointment, the faculty member may be approved for indefinite tenure following a review through the campus promotion and tenure process, or not be reappointed.  In unusual circumstances and prior to the final review year, a “Q” appointment may be renewed for up to two additional years with the approval of the provost (or designee).</p>
<h2><a id="nontenured"></a>C.    <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://oaadocs.uic.edu/107-NTTAppointment.pdf" target="_blank">Non-Tenured Faculty/Appointments</a></span></h2>
<p>Article II C, Section 3a (2) of the University of Illinois <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.bot.uillinois.edu/statutes" target="_blank"><strong><em>Statutes</em></strong></a></span>, provides that “the bylaws of a unit may grant specified faculty privileges to members of the faculty of the unit or of other units who are neither tenured nor receiving probationary credit toward tenure, and who have the rank or title of professor, associate professor, assistant professor, instructor or lecturer.”  The unit bylaws may further grant specified faculty privileges to faculty members with modified faculty titles under the terms “research,” “adjunct,” “clinical,” “visiting,” and/or “emeritus.”  Only academic staff with titles listed above may be extended faculty privileges.  A brief description of the various non-tenured faculty appointments are listed below.</p>
<h3>1.      <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://oaadocs.uic.edu/107-NTTAppointment.pdf" target="_blank">Clinical Faculty</a></span><a name="_Toc462410990"></a></h3>
<p>Clinical faculty hold positions through which they contribute to the service and teaching missions of the University.  A terminal degree is generally required and appointments with the clinical rank are appropriate for those who work primarily in a clinical and/or teaching setting.  Ranks held by clinical faculty include instructor, assistant professor, associate professor, and professor.  All titles of clinical faculty must contain the term “clinical” as a modifier to the title, for example, Clinical Associate Professor.  Clinical faculty are not eligible for tenure, but are eligible for promotion in the clinical track based on procedures established by the University under their Campus Promotion and Tenure Guidelines.  Salaried clinical faculty at 50 percent time or greater must be searched for and appointed through the hiring procedures established for non-tenure track faculty.  While individual faculty members hired in a tenure-track probationary appointment may switch to a clinical appointment during the first four years of their probationary period (exceptions may be granted), such a switch requires appropriate documentation from the department head, endorsement by the dean, and approval from both the provost and vice president for academic affairs.  Additionally, clinical appointments should not be used as a means of retaining tenure-probationary faculty members who are not successful in attaining tenure and promotion.</p>
<h3>2.      <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://oaadocs.uic.edu/107-NTTAppointment.pdf" target="_blank">Research Faculty</a></span></h3>
<p>Research faculty are appointed on a fixed-term basis to work on research projects either independently or in collaboration with other UIC faculty; they are members of the academic staff of UIC.  A terminal degree is required with experience to develop a substantial research and publication record.  Ranks held by research faculty include assistant professor, associate professor, and professor.  All titles of research faculty must contain the term “research” as a modifier to the title, for example, Research Associate Professor. Research faculty are not eligible for tenure, but are eligible for promotion in the research track based on procedures established by the University under their Campus Promotion and Tenure Guidelines. Salaried research faculty at 50 percent time or greater must be searched for and appointed through the hiring procedures established for non-tenure track faculty. Additionally, research appointments should not be used as a means of retaining tenure-probationary faculty members who are not successful in attaining tenure and promotion.</p>
<h3>3.      <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://oaadocs.uic.edu/109-WAgreement.pdf" target="_blank">Special Written Agreement for Definite Term (“W”) Appointments</a></span></h3>
<p>By execution of a “special written agreement,” for definite term (“W” Agreement) a faculty member waives rights to all tenure provisions contained in Article X of the University of Illinois <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.bot.uillinois.edu/statutes" target="_blank"><strong><em>Statutes</em></strong></a></span>.  A “special written agreement” requires that the faculty member be paid partially (at least 50 percent time) or wholly from non-State funds.</p>
<p>The authority for a “special written agreement” is through the president and defined in the University of Illinois <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.bot.uillinois.edu/statutes"><strong><em>Statutes</em></strong></a></span>, Article X, Section 1a(1).  The president’s designee is the chancellor, who in turn has delegated this authority to the provost.</p>
<p>The “W” agreement is necessary on occasion when the University’s interest is best served by offering a rank of Assistant Professor (at 51% or greater), Associate Professor or Professor to a faculty member who either is not on the tenure track or has not been reviewed for tenure.  It should not be used to provide faculty, who are in the latter stages of the probationary period, an escape from the tenure track when an unfavorable tenure review is anticipated or has already occurred.</p>
<h3>4.      <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://oaadocs.uic.edu/107-NTTAppointment.pdf" target="_blank">Lecturers and Instructors</a></span></h3>
<p>Lecturers and instructors are appointed on a fixed-term basis for teaching duties, and for research and service that supports teaching.  They generally have professional experience or expertise in the area of instruction and are generally not required to have a terminal degree.</p>
<h3>5.      <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://oaadocs.uic.edu/107-NTTAppointment.pdf" target="_blank">Visiting and Adjunct in Faculty Titles</a></span></h3>
<p>“Visiting” may be used in the title of a faculty appointment when the individual to be appointed is to be a temporary appointee of one year or less.  Such appointments may be renewed for a period generally not longer than five years when the funding source is non-state.  Appointments beyond three years (state funded) or five years (non-state funded) imply permanent status and if they are to continue should be converted to permanent appointments in accordance with established campus policies.</p>
<p>The use of “adjunct” as a prefix to a faculty rank indicates that the position is not the individual’s primary position.  Adjunct may be used in the title of a faculty appointment when the individual to be appointed is expected to have some sort of short-term, peripheral association with the University or when a department wishes to provide a more formal affiliation to a faculty member from another unit.  The individual appointed should be recognized in his/her field and departments should exercise appropriate review procedures before making an adjunct appointment.</p>
<p>The use of visiting and adjunct as prefixes to faculty ranks excludes eligibility for tenure.  Therefore, care must be taken to assure that the individual being appointed is a bona fide visitor or adjunct appointee; these titles cannot be used merely as a means of avoiding a tenure-track or tenured appointment.</p>
<h2><a id="other"></a>D.    <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://oaadocs.uic.edu/107-NTTAppointment.pdf" target="_blank">Other Non-Tenured Appointments Associated with Faculty</a></span></h2>
<h3>1.      <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://oaadocs.uic.edu/107-NTTAppointment.pdf" target="_blank">Departmental/Institute/Center Affiliate</a></span></h3>
<p>Departmental/Institute/Center Affiliate was established to provide greater flexibility in the sharing of services of faculty members.  Less formal in nature than a regular joint appointment (which generally carries voting rights and tenure status in each department), the departmental/institute/center affiliate designation would not carry with it any tenure rights or voting rights in the affiliated department/unit.  The designation would be available only to faculty members who otherwise have an academic position in the University in a “home department.”  The appointment would be made annually with the concurrence of the home department and the affiliated department/unit and acceptance by the individual and could be terminated either by the department/unit or the individual.  The position authorizes the Affiliate to direct Masters and Ph.D. theses in the affiliated department in the normal manner of other members of that department (subject to the usual rules of the Graduate College).</p>
<p>The affiliated department/unit may wish to contribute temporarily to the salary of the affiliate.  This can be done by either 1) a transfer of funds to the affiliate’s home department, or 2) designating a percentage appointment in the affiliated department with a corresponding percentage reduction in home department.  Arrangements should be made in advance between the departments and the individual regarding the length and funding arrangements for such an appointment.  For purposes of promotion, only the home department will be involved since the title of Affiliate does not designate faculty rank per se or carry any implications for tenure.</p>
<h3>2.      <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://oaadocs.uic.edu/107-NTTAppointment.pdf" target="_blank">Associates</a></span></h3>
<p>Titles included in the academic ranks include teaching associate, clinical associate and postdoctoral research associate (although listed as research associate in the University of Illinois <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.bot.uillinois.edu/statutes" target="_blank"><strong><em>Statutes</em></strong></a></span>, the Chicago campus does not currently allow the use of research associate without the postdoctoral modifier).  Persons qualified for these ranks are appointed at a percent time and under the direction of a faculty member.  Unlike associate appointments, the postdoctoral fellow is generally a zero percent time affiliation.  Various types of fellowships exist at UIC either at the departmental level or at the campus level.  Most fellowships are accompanied by a stipend and a tuition and service fee waiver.</p>
<h3>3.      <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://oaadocs.uic.edu/107-NTTAppointment.pdf" target="_blank">Visiting Scholar</a></span></h3>
<p>The “Visiting Scholar” designation is assigned to international or domestic research scholars and members of the teaching faculty who come to UIC that collaborate or study in some part of the University’s academic community on a short-term appointment.  Eligibility for an international visiting scholar appointment requires that the individual hold J1 visa status (exchange visitor).  Eligibility for a domestic visiting scholar in residence requires that the individual be on a leave or sabbatical from their current employer.  Individuals who have not completed the Ph.D. or other terminal degree may not be hired as a visiting scholar at UIC.</p>
<p>Additionally, for international scholars where salary support is provided by the individual’s home country, documentation of the level of support must be provided at the time the appointment is processed.  The complexity of U.S. immigration laws and regulations pertaining to non-immigrant aliens makes consultation with the UIC Office of International Services highly advisable early in the recruitment process.</p>
<h2><a id="courtesy"></a>E.     Non-Salaried Courtesy Appointments</h2>
<p>Non-salaried or “courtesy” appointments are made by the department to recognize contributions by persons who are otherwise employed outside UIC, but contribute in some way to the teaching, research and service missions.  The specific conditions of all these appointments are determined by each school and college, but usually these appointments are for one year or less and may be extended each year based on departmental/college review.  Although these appointments carry faculty ranks, i.e., assistant, associate, or full professor, they are not tenure-track or tenured appointments.  Criteria for a courtesy appointment to any faculty rank should be consistent with the criteria used for appointments to those for regular faculty to the extent applicable.</p>
<h2><a id="graduatecollege"></a>F.     Faculty Appointments to the Graduate College</h2>
<p>The faculty of the Graduate College shall be prescribed by the University of Illinois <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.bot.uillinois.edu/statutes" target="_blank"><strong><em>Statutes</em></strong></a></span>. Faculty membership in the Graduate College is granted by the dean of the Graduate College or his/her designee on behalf of the Executive Committee of the Graduate College.  Nominations for membership shall be made by the Executive Officer of the department of other equivalent unit.  There are four categories of faculty membership:  1) Full membership, which is granted for the term of employment to those members of the tenure system faculty (tenure-track and tenured) who have been recommended by the department or other teaching or research divisions.  In the College of Medicine, this recommendation is limited to appointments in the Research Track (RT); 2) Associate membership, which is granted to members of the clinical track or non-tenure system faculty, allows the faculty member to serve as a primary advisor for graduate students; 3). Adjunct membership, which is granted for a three-year (renewable) term upon recommendation of the Executive Officer of the department or equivalent unit to adjunct faculty who  meet the standards of membership, and 4) Courtesy membership, which is granted either on a committee by committee basis or for one year to non-UIC individuals who meet the standards for membership.  Associate, Adjunct, and Courtesy members have floor privileges but not voting rights at Graduate College Faculty meetings. For further information refer to the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://grad.uic.edu/graduate-college-bylaws" target="_blank">Graduate College Bylaws</a></span>.</p>
<h2><a id="namedappointments"></a>G.    <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://oaadocs.uic.edu/105-NamedChairsProfessors.pdf" target="_blank">Named Faculty Appointments</a></span></h2>
<p>In an era of acute competition for the best teachers and researchers, privately funded endowments furnish a flexible resource that the University can use to support a wide range of priorities.  Creating an endowed fund allows the endowment to carry the name of the donor or the name of a person or organization to be honored by the donor.  Named faculty appointments at the UIC result from these endowments and they vary in type and level, e.g., a named chair, a named professorship, a named research fund, etc.   Providing support to faculty who are building a national reputation is one way to ensure the continued quality of the professorate at UIC.  The income from an endowment may be used to augment the salary of the professor, as well as to support his or her scholarly and research needs, help fund specific teaching and research requirements, including laboratory equipment, support staff, graduate assistants, research materials and computer equipment.</p>
<p>Named appointments to the faculty require review at the campus level, regardless of where the appointment is held.  Named appointments/titles, generally at zero percent (0%), must accompany an underlying faculty appointment and tenure resides in the professorial appointment, never in the named appointment.  This applies even when a portion of the salary is paid from the endowment and a percent time must be assigned to the named appointment.  The <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.uif.uillinois.edu/" target="_blank">University of Illinois Foundation</a></span> is the official private gift-procurement arm of the University.  Since its formation in 1935 as a non-profit corporation, the Foundation has been a significant contributing factor in the success of the University’s endowment programs.  For additional information on the procedures for appointment access the link above.<strong><br />

<h2><a id="international"></a>H.    International Faculty</h2>
<p>The University of Illinois at Chicago, through the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.ois.uic.edu/" target="_blank">Office of International Services</a></span> (OIS), provides assistance in obtaining both employment-based non-immigrant (H-1B, TN, etc.) and immigrant (“green card”) visa categories for international faculty. Hiring units are urged to contact <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.ois.uic.edu/" target="_blank">OIS</a></span> prior to making an offer of employment.  The potential employee is also responsible for contacting OIS directly to discuss their current immigration status.</p>
<p>It is important to address visa issues promptly in order to avoid situations where individuals cannot secure the necessary immigration documents in time to teach, conduct research, or fulfill other responsibilities because immigration status does not permit employment.  Permanent resident status is necessary for permanent employees, since six years is the limit for non-immigrant status. If the prospective permanent employee does not have this status, a delay of approximately one to two years can be expected in obtaining the permanent residency, if it can be obtained at all.</p>
<h2><a id="positionannouncements"></a>I.       Faculty Position Announcements</h2>
<p>A list of faculty position announcements can be found on the UIC Home Page under <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.uic.edu/about/job-opportunities" target="_blank">Job Opportunities</a></span>.</p>
<h2><a id="termination"></a>J.      Termination of Employment</h2>
<h3>1.      <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://oaadocs.uic.edu/901-NoticeofNonReappointment.pdf" target="_blank">Notice of Non-Reappointment for Non-Tenured Faculty</a></span></h3>
<p>There are two periods during the year when decisions regarding notice of non-reappointment must be made by the departments and colleges:  before March 1 and before August 16.  Assistant professors at more than 50% of full-time service in years two through six of the probationary period should be given notice of non-reappointment by the department before August 16, to be effective at the completion of the following appointment year.  Assistant professors at more than 50% of full-time service in year one of the probationary period and full-time research associates, teaching associates, and faculty holding modified research titles (e.g., Research Associate Professor) on a non-tenured basis and paid from “hard” funds (i.e., state, auxiliary, and revolving accounts) must be given notice of non-reappointment by the department prior to March 1 to be effective at the completion of the current appointment year.  Assistant professors at 50% or less of full-time service are not eligible for notice rights.</p>
<p>It is expected that the faculty listed above who require a six month notice and are paid from hard funds will have appointment dates consistent with the academic/appointment year, i.e., August 16 through August 15 of the following year.  Although the department and/or college must notify the faculty member of non-reappointment in writing, it is the Board of Trustees that gives the official notice.  If notice is given later than six months before the end of the annual contract, or after March 1 in the case of an academic year appointment, it shall be accompanied by an offer of a terminal contract for one additional year of service.</p>
<p>Research faculty and research and teaching associates who are on “non-tenured” appointments and are less than full-time, or whose contracts indicate subject to the availability of funds do not require formal notice of non-reappointment by the Board of Trustees. Moreover, notice of non-reappointment is not required in the case of any appointment at the rank of instructor or lecturer, or for any appointment that includes in the title the term “adjunct,” “clinical,” or “visiting.” Nevertheless, good personnel practice requires that such appointees be given as much notice as possible when a decision regarding non-reappointment has been made. Collective bargaining agreement provisions may also require notification.  Refer to the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.hr.uic.edu/labor_relations/labor_agreements/" target="_blank">UIC Office of Labor and Employee Relations</a></span> for further information.</p>
<p>Although there is no statutory requirement, an associate or full professor in the final year of a “Q” appointment (who was not put forward for tenure review) and is not to be reappointed should be given adequate notice of non-reappointment by the unit.</p>
<p>Assistant, associate and full professors on a “W” contract must be given notice of non-reappointment by the Board of Trustees in accordance with the terms specified in the “Special Written Agreement to Accept Academic Appointment and Reappointment for Definite Terms.”  The notice of non-reappointment period is indicated in the special written agreement as agreed upon by the faculty member and the department head, and generally ranges from six to twelve months.</p>
<p>For additional information on applicability and procedures refer to the link above.</p>
<h3>2.      Resignation</h3>
<p>Faculty resignations must be submitted in writing to the department head or other appropriate administrative officer. In accordance with state law, the health and life insurance coverage provided by the state and the benefits that are available to active employees under the State Universities Retirement System (<span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.surs.com/" target="_blank">SURS</a></span>) cease as of the resignation date. Under federal legislation enacted in 1986, a continuation option via the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) exists that permits resigning employees to continue insurance coverage.  Employees are responsible for the premiums if coverage is continued. For University employees, COBRA applies to the State health, dental, and vision coverage. Continuation for COBRA-qualified dependents shall be identical to the employee&#8217;s health, dental, and vision coverage under which they were covered at the time coverage was lost. For additional information, contact the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.hr.uillinois.edu/benefits/" target="_blank">Benefits Center</a></span>.</p>
<p>Faculty members employed at UIC for the academic year (nine-month appointments) may continue their benefits through the summer only if they resign on and request continued payment through August 15.</p>
<h3>3.      Retirement</h3>
<p>Faculty retirements must be submitted in writing to the department head or other appropriate administrative officer.  A retiring faculty member should notify SURS as soon as possible regarding their pending retirement date. Retirement dates for nine-month faculty should normally occur on the following dates only:  December 31 (end of fall semester), May 15 (end of spring semester) or August 15 (end of academic year or summer contract).  Retirement dates may occur over the summer at any point between May 16 and August 15 provided a corresponding summer appointment is effective through the proposed retirement date.</p>
<p>An employee’s retirement annuity is based on a number of factors.  Visit the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.surs.org/" target="_blank">State Universities Retirement System</a></span> for further information.</p>
<p>Pre-retirement planning conferences are held periodically to provide information and assistance on pre-retirement planning to all interested employees and their spouses.  Refer to <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://nessie.uihr.uillinois.edu/cf/benefits/index.cfm?Item_ID=139" target="_blank">NESSIE</a></span> for further information.</p>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.suaa.org/" target="_blank">State Universities Annuitants Association</a></span> (SUAA) is an organization to promote the individual and collective interests and welfare of its members and retirees of state universities.  Membership is open to all participants in SURS who have retired or who are eligible for a retirement annuity, their spouses, and survivors. See the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://suaa.publish.uic.edu/" target="_blank">UIC chapter of SUAA</a></span> for additional information.</p>
<h3>4.      Method of Final Payment/Service</h3>
<p>Faculty members on an academic-year contract (nine-month) or ten-month contract do not earn vacation. Nevertheless they will be paid upon termination for the percentage of services completed in that contract year. That means a nine-month or academic-year appointee may receive the entire balance due for his/her appointment as of May 15 if all services have been provided during the preceding nine-month period (August 16-May 15). An academic-year appointee has the privilege of receiving his/her salary during the year prior to retirement over a nine-month period (rather than over a twelve-month period) so that the retirement annuity can begin June 1.  This irrevocable election for period of payment must be made prior to the payroll calculation for the first monthly payment in the final year of service (Refer to Section V.A.).  Resignation dates for nine-month faculty should normally occur on the following dates only:  December 31 (end of fall semester), May 15 (end of spring semester) or August 15 (end of academic year or summer contract).</p>
<p>The method of final payment for unused vacation time is subject to the approval of the department head. Faculty on twelve-month contracts who retire, resign, or otherwise terminate their employment with the university may be paid for accumulated vacation earned, but not taken, as of the date of termination up to a maximum of 48 working days, or they may wish or be asked to take their vacation before the completion of their contracts. However, terminating faculty on a twelve-month contract cannot use accumulated vacation to extend their termination date beyond their last day of actual employment.  Department heads are advised to provide reasonable notice when asking a faculty member to take vacation before the completion of the employee’s contract.</p>
<p>An employee who transfers from one position to another and remains on a twelve-month contract with continuing service may not be paid for accumulated vacation and sick leave. Any balance of vacation and/or sick leave will transfer to the new position.</p>
<h3>5.      Death and Survivors’ Benefits</h3>
<p>When beginning participation in the retirement system, university employees are given a beneficiary designation form. This information should be kept current by notifying the State Universities Retirement System (<span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.surs.com/" target="_blank">SURS</a></span>) of such events as the birth of a child or the death of a beneficiary. The law governing SURS provides that divorce disqualifies the former spouse from receiving survivors’ insurance benefits. A former spouse must be designated or re-designated as beneficiary after the date of the divorce to be eligible for any lump-sum death benefit that is not a survivors’ insurance benefit. The beneficiary designation is for lump-sum death benefits and does not have any bearing on survivor benefits.</p>
<p>The SURS provides retirement, disability, death, and survivor benefits to eligible SURS participants and annuitants.  As of April 1998, SURS active members must choose from one of three retirement options (see below) within the first six months from the date SURS receives their certification of employment from the employer.  Employees who fail to choose within six months, will be permanently enrolled in the Traditional Benefit Package:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional Benefit Package: The historical SURS Defined Benefit retirement plan which until 1998 was the only SURS plan available.</li>
<li>Portable Benefit Package: A Defined Benefit retirement plan that has much in common with the Traditional Benefit Package.  However, it provides a more generous separation refund for those who leave the system.</li>
<li>Self-Managed Plan (SMP): A Defined Contribution plan that establishes an account in the employee’s name into which your contributions and the employer (State of Illinois) contributions are placed. You decide how your account balance will be invested, selecting from a variety of mutual funds, stable value funds, and variable annuities.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6.      <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://oaadocs.uic.edu/902-EmeritusStatus.pdf" target="_blank">Emeritus/Emerita Status</a></span></h3>
<p>The granting of emeritus status to retiring faculty and senior administrative staff members is based on merit. At UIC, the emeritus designation is regarded as an extraordinary title that is given for extraordinary service. Accordingly, emeritus status is bestowed on only those individuals who have contributed measurably to the University of Illinois at Chicago.  Faculty eligible for emeritus status includes those in professorial ranks (professors and associate professors) and research and clinical faculty.  Senior administrative staff are defined as chancellors and deans.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, emeritus status will not be granted to an individual who has served less than seven years. Exceptions to this policy may be considered for an individual who has made an outstanding contribution to the university during a briefer period of service. Emeritus status may be granted prior to retirement for those who have served the university in an eligible administrative position for at least five years and who resign such positions to return to the faculty.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc462411011"></a>7.      Retiree’s Benefits</h3>
<p>A retiree’s identification card verifies the retiree’s right to enjoy many of the privileges and services offered by the University.  To obtain an <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://idcenter.uic.edu/idcard.shtml" target="_blank">i-card</a></span>, a retiree must have proof of retirement from their department, as well as a valid driver’s license, passport or state ID card.  There is currently no charge for the first ID as long as the retiree turns in the previous faculty/staff card; however, there is a replacement fee for lost or stolen cards.</p>
<p>Retiree benefits include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>library privileges to all retirees without restriction,</li>
<li>retirees may enroll in courses or attend classes without payment of tuition or fees, assuming that other conditions governing enrollment in such courses are satisfactorily met,</li>
<li>retirees may purchase a recreational facilities membership for the same price as faculty by showing their retiree i-card,</li>
<li>retirees may continue their personal listing in the staff directory by making arrangements with their home department, and</li>
<li>other related services as outlined in the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.hr.uic.edu/UserFiles/Servers/Server_2716/File/d_my_benefits/2017RetirementGuide.pdf" target="_blank">UIC Retiree’s Guide</a></span>.</li>

<h2><a id="reemployment"></a>K.    <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.hr.uic.edu/hiring/hiringuiretiree/" target="_blank">Re-Employment of University of Illinois Retirees or SURS Annuitants</a></span></h2>
<p>Re-employment of University retirees is a wise human resource practice for the University.  Re-employing such retirees from time to time can help the University achieve quality and value objectives in serving students, conducting research, caring for patients, and managing exceptional circumstances and special needs.  The University expects and requires effective succession planning and does not intend to use University retiree re-employment as a substitute for developing well qualified faculty and staff.</p>
<p>The University of Illinois Board of Trustees policy on the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.trustees.uillinois.edu/trustees/agenda/July-24-25-2013-BOT/011-jul-Rehire-Retirees.pdf" target="_blank">Employment of University of Illinois Retirees and Employment of Other State Universities Retirement System Annuitants</a></span> identifies the following categories of employees that may be re-employed for the purposes described without prior Board of Trustees approval:<br />
1) Retired faculty members who teach courses, advise students, and perform related duties on a part-time basis.<br />
2) Retired faculty or staff members who conduct research on appointments funded by grants and contracts.<br />
3) Retired clinical faculty members who are employed to provide patient care on a part-time or occasional basis.<br />
4) Retirees who are appointed as hourly faculty employees on a temporary basis, and 5) retirees who are appointed on a temporary basis to perform staff functions when other options are not feasible.</p>
